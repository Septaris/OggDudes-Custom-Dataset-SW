  <Description>[H3]Foot Speeder[h3]
These curious contraptions combine the swiftness of a speeder car with an ease of storage and simple construction that makes keeping and maintaining them much less expensive than doing so for an actual vehicle. Foot speeders are contructed around a repulsorlift pad large enough for a single being to stand upon, with a steering vane extending up that doubles as a support for the occupant to hold arms.
[P]A foot speeder allows a person to function as a Silhoette 1, Speed 1, Handling -1, System Strain Threshold 4 vehicle that can only operate in atmosphere, and requires Piloting (Planetary) to operate. It has a flight ceiling of five meters.
[P][I]Note: This vehicle is also included as an inventory gear item.[i]</Description>
