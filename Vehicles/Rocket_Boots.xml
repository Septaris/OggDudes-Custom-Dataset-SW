  <Description>[H3]Rocket Boots[h3]
The ability to turn a leap into an extended flight at will offers a tremendous level of tactical versatility. If an opponent fails to recognize this capacity, then the advantage becomes even more substantial. Rocket boots enable an individual to take flight on a whim, without being as bulky or as obvious as a jetpack.
[P]The convenience of their smaller size comes at a cost, however. Rocket boots cannot operate for extended periods, due to their limited cooling capacity. Furthermore, as they are worn far from a beings center of gravity, they are far more difficult to control.
[P]Rocket boots enable a person to function as a Silhoette 1, Speed 1, Handling -3, System Strain Threshold 3 vehicle that can only operate in atmosphere, and requires Piloting (Planetary) to operate. At the end of each round of activation, the rocket boots suffer 1 system strain as their fuel depletes.
[P][I]Note:  This is the vehicle profile of the rocket boots gear item.[i]</Description>
