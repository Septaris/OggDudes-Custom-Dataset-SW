  <Description>[H3]CR-17 Incendia III[h3]
The new Incendia III is Czerka's latest entry in the competitive facotry custom Podracer market. it is the Podracer pilot's Podracer; light, fast, and simple, with plenty of style and power to spare. Thrust is provided by a pair of Czerka CK-H.2 liquid-injected turbofan engines, usually found on high performance combat airspeeders. A combination of small attitude jets and variable control surfaces provides decent high-speed handling, but the Incendia suggers at lower speeds due to the heaviness of the CK-H.2 engines. The cockpit is one of the most basic offered on a factory custom Podracer. It consists of little more than an acceleration seat with harness, a rudimentary instrument panel, a HOTAS control setup sourced from Czerka's Marauder racing swoop, and a single coil repulsorlift generator. No concessions for pilot comfort were designed into the Incendia's Podracer, and it possesses only the most basic safety features.
[P]The Invendia is among the cheaper factory customs on the market today. It is marketed squarely to budget-minded racign teams and cash-strapped racers just starting their careers. Despite its reputation as a "starter" Podracer, the Incendia has a broad following in the galactic Podracing scene, especially among those racers who appreciate its simplicity and purity.</Description>
