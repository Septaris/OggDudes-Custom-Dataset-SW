  <Description>[H3]LH75 Speciality Live-Haul Freighter[h3]
Designed with a niche purpose in mind, the LH75 Low Orbit Specialty Live-Haul Frigate or L.O.S. Live-Haul manufactured by Rothara Heavy Engineering was the default choice for the transport of massive live cargo by the Republic's Department of Agriculture and Nonsentient Creatures at the time the Clone Wars began. At the start of the war, many non-military vessels were pressed into service in support of the newly formed Grand Army of the Republic, the LH75 among them. Kuat Drive Yards was contracted to complete this task for many vessels, including the LH75. The LH75 Live Haul was able to carry and haul the spatial and weight equivalent of three fully grown bull rancors with relative ease, even into low orbit. With minimal modification by KDY and the original manufacturer (a subsidiary), the LH75 was soon fit to transport up to three squads and their support vehicles. Unsurprisingly, the LH75 was uniquely suitable among the GAR's landing craft for the transport of riding beasts. As the war progressed, Clone Troopers operating on a number of worlds made use of local life for transportation and even combat, such as the Blurrg of Ryloth. Some of these ad-hoc cavalry units found the mounts so useful, that officers arranged for permanent acquisition of the creatures. The LH75 was a natural choice for deployment of these mounted units.
[P]Having never been intended to operate near the front lines, the L.O.S. Live-Haul was lightly armed and often traveled with a protective escort near active combat zones. Still, clone troopers found ways to improvise combat readiness out of this lightweight yet massive ship. With the massive cargo doors open during flight. troopers were able lay down small-arms fire by securing themselves to the many freight webbing hook points throughout the cargo bay floor originally intended as tie points for live cargo.
[P]Due to the limited production run of these ships and sometimes-reckless usage by clone troopers, the L.O.S. Live-Haul is a rare find today. Owing to its mammoth power intake, the occasional intact ship is more commonly used as a storage facility on Outer Rim planets. Fewer still have found their way into the hands of smugglers wishing to transport massive live game for wealthy customers.</Description>
