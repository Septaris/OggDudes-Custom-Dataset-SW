      [H3]3-MAL Secure Comlink[h3]
Popular throughout the Rebel Alliance, the 3-MAL Comlink is a versatile comms system squeezed into a tiny, pill-shaped package. In addition to military-grade encryption, the 3-MAL scans popular civil defense, emergency services, and law enforcement frequencies. Like most comlinks on the market, the 3-MAL easily synchronizes with properly equipped droids, computers, sensors, and cyborg units, and can transm it either voice or data.
[P]This comlink transmits up to medium range on the planetary scale. The 3-MAL’s encryption adds [SE] to any check made to intercept and unscramble the signal. Monitoring a standard clear frequency on a civilized world can add [BO][BO] to Knowledge checks related to current events or conditions at the GM’s discretion.</Description>

      [H3]Swift 78B Vessel Courier System[h3]
[P]The Swift 78B vessel courier system is a discreet, cybernetically implanted data storage device. Often used by couriers in instances where physical data storage devices are liable to be found or confiscated, the vessel courier system can carry enough information to fill four conventional datapads. [P]The information is accessed via a small dataport that is secured beneath a tiny flap of synthflesh, usually beneath the courier’s hairline. Because the vessel courier system is independent of the courier, the data within it cannot be accessed or modified by him.
[P]The Rebel Alliance has utilized vessel courier systems to move large amounts of sensitive data between bases and outposts without drawing undue attention. It is also a popular device with criminal organizations and freelance couriers.</Description>

Tracing consoles are most commonly found within espionage agencies and other sensitive installations, but they could be used by any group concerned about the security of its electronic systems to which they are linked, logging all attempts at access and monitoring for unsual activity. Once irregularities are logged, the console can be used to assist in following the disturbance to its source.
[P]A tracing console can be installed to monitor a single system, such as a buildin's data network or a ship's computer. Computers checks to slice a system protected in this way suffer [SE] due to the difficulty of avoiding notice. A defended slicer using the console gains [BO][BO] to Computers checks to identify any intuder as by the Trace User action (see [B]Slicing Encounters,[b] page 87).</Description>

[P]The aquata breather is a small device consisting of two small tanks connected to a mouthpiece. It provides its user with up to two hours of breathable air, and it especially useful in subaquatic environments. Most Jedi Knights who could not naturally breathe water took aquata breathers with them on their missions, even if they did not predict aquatic travel.
[P]While the aquata breather is an incredibly useful survival tool, it is also designed to be entirely disposable. Once the two hour air supply is used, it cannot be recharged.

      [H3]Remote DVI Activator (Long Range)[h3]

Useful for those needing to make a speedy getaway, a remote activation controller (also known as a beckon call) is a small, handheld device that can be worn on the wrist or stowed in a pocket. Linked to a slave circuit, a beckon call allows the user to remotely activate the coupled vehicle or starship. Inexpensive, low-end models, such as the Bespin Motors Remote DVI Activator, have relatively short ranges of no more than two to five kilometers, while exceptionally sophisticated beckon calls can transmit through hyper-space up to a parsec and instruct the ship's autopilot to fly to the user's location.

[P]Inexpensive models simply activate the vehicle or ship's engines from no more than 5 kilometers away and run simple pre-flight checks, allowing the pilot to take off right away. More advanced beckon calls can summon a vehicle or starship, though the autopilot is only capable of performing simple maneuvers, which can be complicated by weather conditions and other obstacles. Some models can be used to remotely pilot a vehicle or starship via slave circuit, though this requires a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Piloting check[b]. </Description>

      [H3]Adamite Signet Ring[h3]
When the Paladins of the Adamite Tower  agree to accept a new member to their ranks, they present that individual with one of the extremely rare blades of their order. That novice must travel deep into the ruined depths of the Adamite Tower. There, they must cut a ring of  metal from one of the impossibly tough metal fitting; metal that cannot be forged by any technology on Weik. They carve their crest and the symbol of the Tower on the ring with the tip of their blade and this signet ring forever declares them to be a Paladin.
[P]Possessing a signet ring signifies to anyone on Weik that the character is one of the Paladins of the Adamite Tower. Possessing a signet ring under false pretenses earns the lasting enmity of all Paladins and their allies.</Description>

Affide crystals are commonly used as a last-resort "suicide pill" in the event of capture or torture. Typically hidden in a false tooth implanted in the agent's jaw, affide crystals are an extremely powerful neuro-toxin that, upon exposure to moisture, can kill an individual in seconds by immediately stopping respiratory functions. To use them, agents simply bite down hard on their false tooth, shattering it and allowing the crystal to dissolve in their mouth. Depending on the agent's species and constitution, death can take from 20 to 40 seconds.
[P] A single affide crystal is a poison that requires an upgraded [B]Daunting ([CH][DI][DI][DI]) Resilience check[b] to overcome when ingested. The poison inflicts 10 wounds and a Critical Injury on a failed check. Each [TH] generated adds +40 to the roll for the Critical Injury result. GMs may spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] to kill a target instantly, leaving no opportunity for resuscitation.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]Agent's Bag[h3]
This is a catchall term for the various confidential packets, courier bags, and attaché cases that intelligence agents have modified for missions in the field. Agent bags are produced in a vast number of styles and types. Some are created for specific tasks, but most are geared toward general survival and work in the field. A typical agent's bag is a workaday, hide-covered attaché case used to carry important documents. It has reinforced hardware and a light armorweave that is good against slugthrower and light blaster fire. Secret compartments sewn into the liner can conceal things like credit chips, hard currency, throwing knives, micro-scanners, listening bugs, miniature holorecorders, and other tools an active agent might need in the field. Some bags are shielded against sensors and scanners, some are equipped with powerful stun fields in case the bag is stolen, and some are even rigged to explode when opened improperly or without entering a combination.
[P]The exact specifications of an agent bag vary by agency and agent, and are left to the Game Master's discretion. The [B]Gear Attachments[b] section, on page 58 of Cyphers and Masks, has many possible items for inclusion in a customized agent's bag, and players and GMs are encouraged to create new attachments as well.</Description>

Popular with weapon crewmen, squad support gunners, and anyone who makes a living behind the sights of a heavy man-portable or vehicle-mounted weapon, Fabritech's AG/I Mk. III targeting goggles are the best selling targeting aid on the galactic market today. Worn over a shooter's eyes, the Mk. III goggles use a number of physical and electronic systems to improve a gunner's combat effectiveness. Along with a highly detailed holographic targeting reticule, the Mk.III also provides a user with varying strengths of telescopic zoom, low-light vision, and a number of filters to reduce glare and eye fatigue. In addition, the goggles are equipped with a small, powerful ballistic computer that can instantly plot firing solutions, label and rank enemies by threat level, track friendlies, and generally increase accuracy while reducing waste and incidents of friendly fire.

[P]Wearing an AG/I Mk. III targeting goggles allows the character to count the silhouette of his target as one greater when making Gunnery checks targeting a starship or vehicle.</Description>

[P]Designed to restrain the particularly slippery individuals, grav-binders use microrepulsor technology to artificially apply the effects of extreme gravity to a captive. Unlike magna-cuffs, heavy-duty binders that employ a magnetic field to be too strong to break, AL-DR8 grav-binders are fitted snugly across the body and use the power of gravity itself to restrict any movement. This makes them favorable for species that have especially flexible or even amorphous bodies, as they must be able to muster the strength to resist the artificial gravity created by the grav-binders before they can even attempt to slip free.
[P]Breaking free from the grav-binders requires the [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI]) Athletics check[b] (due to the restrictive effects of the artificially raised gravity on the whole body, a character cannot slip free of grav-binders using flexibility alone.)</Description>

An appraiser's eye is a combination scanner and cross-reference tool in the form of a cybernetic eye or lens implant.

      [H3]Ardos Disk[h3]

Small coins or medals made of aurodium mined from Varl, Ardos disks are valuable not merely for their rare metal content, but for what they represent. Bearing a stylized image of the star Ardos on one side and the sigil of the kajidic issuing the disk on the other, Ardos disks are given as rewards to highly favored servants and emissaries. They identify the bearer as being under the protection of the Hutts. For a Hutt to kill the possessor of an Ardos disk is nearly as taboo as the murder of another Hutt: most Hutts and their servants honor the relative immunity afforded those given such a rare boon. Conversely, the theft or forgery of an Ardos disk is seen as a heinous act among the Hutts.

[P]Upon displaying an Ardos disk, a character adds [BO][BO] to any Charm or Negotiation skill checks made with Hutts or their henchmen or servants. In general, most Hutts will honor the implicit significance of the Ardos disk and refrain from overtly harming or hindering the bearer. If the disk bears the sigil of a rival clan, however, the GM can upgrade the difficulty of any Charm or Negotiation skill checks with the Hutt in question once instead, though the Hutt will still be loath to openly harm the bearer.

[P]For instance, Jabba Desilijic Tiure might not be very welcoming or polite to characters displaying an Ardos disk given to them by the Besadii Hutts, but he would at least grant them safe passage through Desilijic space, and would not feed them to his pet rancor (at least, not without severe provocation). Since Hutts are extremely suspicious and imperious by their very natures, they often demand to examine any Ardos disk presented to them, even if they already know it is valid.</Description>

Wars between the dark side and the light are not only fought in an individual's conscience. Centuries ago, the Sith Order formed the backbone of a terrifying war machine. One of their most fearsome strongholds resided on the Outer Rim planet of Malachor. Rumors spread that the Sith bastion hid unstoppable weaponry and forbidden knowledge. Fearing the worst, the Jedi laid siege to the temple.
[P]The battle left no survivors. The Jedi archives erased all records of the planet, hoping to bury the Sith secrets along with the dead. Over time, spacers began to claim they had stumbled on the lost world of Malachor. They'd bring back artifacts claimed to be Sith relics. Most were obvious frauds. A few had a genuine-and disquieting-connection to the dark side.
[P]Smugglers claimed to make Ashes of Malachor from the pulverized bones left on the planet. With the planet lost to the galaxy at large, there is no way to confirm this. The results, though, are irrefutable. Some dark essence trapped within the ashes empowers those that consume it. Gruesome power warps their will, increasing their power at the cost of their Morality.
[P]A Force-sensitive character may spend a maneuver to inhale the Ashes of Malachor. They gain 5 Conflict, but add [SU][TH] to all attacks they make until the end of the encounter.</Description>

      [H3]Atgar Artillery Remote[h3]
During assaults, enemy emplacements are high-priority targets, making emplacement gunner fatailites common. Alliance gunners have turned to remotes to operate emplacements from behind cover. Synchronizing a remote to a stationary emplacement requires attaching a signal reciever that comes with the remote an then configuring fussy programming. Atgar SpaceDefence Corporation is the most popular manufacturer of artillery remotes, likely in response to criticsim reagarding exposure while operating older Atgar emplacements.
[P]A character can link a single Gunnery weapon to an Atgar Artillery Remote with a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Computers check[b]. If the weapon is an Atgar SpaceDefence Corporation model, this check is [B]Average([DI][DI])[b] instead. If the character succeeds, the weapon gains the innaccurate 2 quality and the holder of the remote can fire the linked weapon via the remote from up to medium range.

Typically found on heavily populated, highly advanced worlds such as Coruscant, the FasClean Atmospheric Reactive Damper (ARD) produced by Gandorthral Atmospherics is one of the most important environmental engineering devices produced. Using a multitude of systems, FasClean dampers are deployed in the upper atmosphere in large groups where they scrub excess carbon dioxide from a planet's atmosphere. This prevents populous, heavily industrial worlds from succumbing to catastrophic planetary climate change caused by massive amounts of CO2 in the air. ARDs are also used in planetary colonization, especially on worlds with a high percentage of volcanic or geothermal activity.</Description>

Gandorthral Atmospherics is a leading provider of atmospheric engineering systems, producing everything from breath masks and hostile environment suits to massive, city-sized terraforming installations. The smallest of these latter items is the highly respected Elysium Model 2 Atmospheric Processor. Powered by a planet's natural subsurface heat and energy, the Model 2 resembles a massive ziggurat: a stepped, flat-topped pyramid full of systems designed to produce breathable atmospheres, clean water, and even weather patterns from the raw materials at hand. Roughly the size of a star cruiser, the Elysium Model 2 requires a crew of at least one hundred engineers and technicians, not to mention numerous droids to work in areas unfit for their organic colleagues. When deployed to a new colony, these processors commonly form the core of the initial settlement, and many a sprawling city throughout the Outer Rim has a decommissioned or repurposed Model 2 somewhere in its borders. </Description>

As criminals and spies advance their ability to forge documents, the need to detect falsifications becomes paramount.

Avabush spice is a drug that induces relaxation and lethargy, and some use it as an illicit sleep aid. Unlike many varieties of spice, it has no hallucinogenic qualities and does not cause physical addiction in most species. However, it does have one interesting quirk that separates it from countless similar drugs: avabush spice makes users more truthful, and can be used to extract information when combined with targeted and insistent questioning. Though not particularly valuable, avabush can only be found on the planet of Baros and in certain specialized greenhouses that maintain samples. It is considerably less effective than the various truth serums commonly employed by the Empire, but is also harder to detect and less unpleasant for those consuming it.

[P]A character who has consumed avabush spice feels lethargic, and can only upgrade a single [AB] to a [PR] on any given check because of this mental torpor. Further, whenever this character intentionally tries to lie or conceal the truth, the GM upgrades any one [DI] in the dice pool into a [CH] Avabush spice's effects last for one scene or combat encounter.

Key visual characteristics of objects only a few micrometers in size can provide the information necessary to solve a mystery or resolve a crisis.

Though averaging less than a meter in length, albeks are stubborn and aggressive. They have been known to take the intrusion of starship or speeder into their territory as a challenge and often stow away aboard the offending vessel. Once in place, they can be quite difficult to remove as the small creatures have a fierce temper and a unique ability to anticipate blows or grabbing hands with the Force. Pinning down albeks that don;t want to be caught is all but impossible, and usually only makes them more determined to stay where they are.
[P]Some animal trainers have learned to use this stubborn attidude to train the creatures. Getting the beasts to do anything they don;t want to do is all but fultile, but since albeks accpet gifts of food greedily, getting them to do what the trainer wants is simply a matter of getting one to recognize the trainer's value as a provider of treats. Well-fed and placated albeks make for ferocious and territorial guard animals, and ones that are not likely to draw as much attention as larger and more obviously threatening beasts.

Made by a number of companies, most notably Fabritech, beast calls are some of the more simple and effective tools used by hunters and trappers. Little more than a small audio-playback machine encased in a sturdy, impact-resistant shell, a beast call is used to lure creatures out of hiding by speaking to them in their own language. They contain a sophisticated audio-signal modulator similar to those used by droid manufacturers to give their creations voice, as well as a nearly bottomless programmable database capable of holding the various screeches, howls, and calls of numerous known animal species throughout the galaxy. Along with the preprogrammed database, these devices can also record sounds, allowing a user to build his own sound library generated by previously unknown creatures.

[P]To use, a hunter simply sets the type of beast he wants to attract, places the beast call in a convenient area; and activates it. The call then plays back the appropriate sounds at varying pitches and volumes until a creature or creatures are attracted or the user turns the device off. The sounds produced by the beast call are so realistic that members of the species being imitated are hard pressed not to come as quickly as they can to investigate.

[P]Using a beast call to lure an animal requires no skill check, but the beast being targeted must make an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Discipline check[b] to resist the call. To record a particular beast's call to use later, the user must make an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Computers check[b] modified by any other environmental conditions (heavy background noise, atmospheric interference, etc). </Description>

They are surprisingly intelligent for mere beasts, but their natural aggression makes studying or training them difficult for most.</Description>

Exported from Craci in the Corporate Sector, Cracian thumpers have become one of the most widespread riding animals in the galaxy. These bipedal herbivores bear features resembling a mix between that of a large rodent and a horse, and sport sharp claws on both their forelimbs and large, powerful hind legs. They have long faces with broad snouts and upright ears. There are numerous breeds of Cracian thumpers, primarily distinguished between long- and short-hair varieties. The former are well-suited to colder environments, resembling the tauntauns of Hoth. Despite their name, Cracian thumpers naturally move with great stealth, making them ideal mounts for Rebel Beast Riders.</Description>

Small, flight capable mammals that dwell in tight-knit nesting groups of up to a dozen individuals, creereen survie the atention of predators through their mobility and alertness. When trouble is spotted, the rodent-like flyers are able to alert their entire family group with a powerful shriek that disorients predators, while shielding other nearby creereen from negative effects.
[P]Animal trainers who have worked with these creatures have found that once creereen accept them or other designated individuals, the creatures can shield members of other species from their shriek as well. This trait means that while creereen are too easily frightened to serve as true guard animals, there is still a market for trained creereen or even full nesting groups that can serce as living alarm systems.</Description>

The planet Spintir is known to xenobiologists for its curious diversity of mammalian species, but, few of its native lifeforms are as notable as the local glowbats. With a wingspan of just over a meter, the glowbats are not as physically imposeing as the icewolves or powerful Spintiri lynxes that sit at the top of the planet's food chain. However, thanks to the bioluminescent, scaly flakes that collect under their wings, glowbats have managed to carve out a niche or their homeworld with few regular predators and an abundance of prey. By flapping their wings to spray the flakes forward, flowbats can disorient attackers in order to make their escape or stun prey as they swoop in for the kill.
[P]What's more, glowbats are able to regulate their bioluminescence for purposes other than predation and defense. They can dim the glow under their wings to avoid attention, or flare it in modulated sequences to communicate with each other. The last capability is used to negotiate territorial boundaries or attract mates, although some Spintiri locals believe it might be possible to train the glowbats to produce signals on command.</Description>

While some believe that hurghols ingest a mineral diet, as they lick or even chew at the rocks of their mountain homes. In truth they only draw in trace elements from this habit, used to strengthen their hides against harsh elements. As far as can be determined, they do not need to eat at all in the commonly understood sense, instead drawing all the energy needed to survive from the Force itself. Stories have circulated through the galaxy of incredible feats of endurance by hurghols such as falling down a steep inclines and breaking legs, then climbing out unperturbed months laterm after the limbs healed naturally.</Description>

While considerably larger than the average equinoid, lava fleas have an uncharacteristically lightweight frame. This makes them ideal for leaping considerable distances, but less adapted for hauling heavy loads. The creature's exoskeleton evolved an internal structure of spindles not unlike an internal bone structure, made from the minerals the lava flea digests. This allows these extraordinary beasts to grow to sizes far beyond normal evolutionary constraints. Mustafarians often fashion discarded lava flea shells into heat-resistant armor.</Description>

They demand is driven part by their fearsome appearance with a huge toothy maw, four beady eyes and massive claw-tipped paws, all backed up by a pair of barbed tail spikes. What's more, nexu are fully as lethal as their natural armament would suggest, and possess a temperment and instictive cunning that make them even greater threats.
[P]Although naturally stealthy and elusive, nexu do not lack for ferocity or mettle in a direct fight, and they rarely back down in the face of any threat they encounter. Even then faced wth more ferocious predator, nexu are more likely to attempt to melt away into the underbrush or other cover and attack again using stealth to gain the advantage than to simply flee their hunting grounds. Of course, this means that training such fierce beasts is a dangerous and unforgiving task, but the demand for them means there are always those willing to take the risk.</Description>

Despeite all these disadvantages, porvir thrive across nearly every world on which they c an be found, regardless of the predatory species present—thanks to a natural affinity for the Force.
[P]Provir have the innate ability to discourage hostile attention by using the Force in a way similar to the mind tricks that Force users sometimes emply to persuade the weak willed. While sentient beings usually have the mental fortitude to harm or capture porvir if they try, most other animals simply ignore the creatures as if they were not present, or at least  inedible.

In their native habitat, on Ylesia or other worlds to which they were less cruelly transplanted, reeks graze in herds. While these massive quardupeds defend each other fiercely with huge tusks, horns and clawed feet, they remain largely docile in the absence of outside threats. Some frontier worlds have experimented with using the beasts as pack animals hoping that their hardiness and capacity for self-defence would make up for the difficulty of training them.

Whatever planet the short-tailed rodents came from originally, their capacity for camouflage has aided them in stowing away on ships and spreading to many locations. Once established in a new habitat, packs of runderen typically seek out whatever environment offers the most abundant source of food, typically feasting on plentiful garbage across districts that cannot afford extensive fighting to expose the dark-dwelling  creatures.
[P]If allowed to flourish, runderen can become nearly impossible to eradicate. They can regulate the hue and shade of their dark coats to better blend into the shadows of any area they inhabit, thanks to an array of subdermal chemical glands. Their fur always remains dark enough to make them stand out in bright light, but provided they have even a few shadows to scurry between, they  become extremely difficult to detect, much less evict.</Description>

      [H3]Tauntaun[h3]

Native to the frigid environs of Hoth, the common tauntaun is the largest of several species of the bipedal reptomammals. These iconic beasts are herbivorous, feeding on lichens and small plants that thrive in caverns and other areas warmed by Hoth's geothermal energies. Heavy fur and a layer of blubber keeps them alive in all but the coldest conditions their home planet has to offer. Standing up to 2.5 meters tall, tauntauns make excellent, if stubborn, mounts for scouting duties in brutally cold conditions, where even vehicles have trouble adjusting.</Description>

      [H3]Thranta[h3]

Now an endangered species, the thranta were once a common sight in the skies of Alderaan prior to the planet's destruction. Unlike many other flying creatures, thrantas do not use their wings as a primary source of lift. Rather, their bodies naturally produce hydrogen, which is stored in several internal air sacs that keep them aloft. This may be one reason why thrantas evolved to be creatures purely of the air, no longer needing legs on which to land. Over time, Alderaanians domesticated numerous breeds of this beast to be used as mounts. Today, only the common and baleen thrantas survive in any measurable quantity. One of the few places one can find a thranta is above the clouds on the tibanna-producing gas giants of Bespin.</Description>

The creatures run rampant and feral on the lower levels of the Smuggler's Moon, hunting in packs for anything or anyone they can catch.
[P]The Hutt crime lords of Nar Shaddaa find the vicious creatures and their activities endlessly amusing, and some Hutts bring a gunting pack with them when traveling to other worlds.

Unusually for cybernetic implants, a biofeedback regulator achieves nothing for the recipient when installed on its own. This complex full-body system takes substantial expertiese to install, and is intended to be integrated with additional cybernetic enhancements. When hooked into existing or newly installed enhancements, the regulator redirects natural bioelectricity flows to work with the power supplies of artificial limbs or to supplement the functioning of pieces that add new capablities to the user's body. The regulator is thoroughly integrated with the autoimmune repsonses of the body as well, preventing them from rejecting even the most copious of upgrades.
[P]A biofeedback implant regulator increases the character's cybernetic implant cap by two (see page 173 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rulebook). A biofeedback regulator does not count toward the character's cybernetic implant cap. Biofeedback regulators cannot be installed on droids and characters can only have a single biofeedback regulator cybernetic installed.

Derived from an industrial dye used in large-scale construction operations such as the creation of starships, booster blue is a performance enhancing drug popular amongst pilots and gunmen.

Though nobody seems to know the drug's exact history, apparently some intrepid soul came to the realization that by consuming this chemical concoction meant for painting starships, humans and many other species can temporarily benefit from drastically boosted reaction times. Of course, this power is not without a price—booster blue has a number of deleterious side-effects, and overdoses are common, especially amongst pilots who attempt to overlap applications of the drug during extended combat operations.

[P]A character under the effects of booster blue may upgrade the ability of any Agility, Intellect, or Cunning related check he undertakes once, reflecting his improved concentration and mental acuity. However, this artificial focus takes a toll on the mind. A character under the effects of booster blue may not remove strain at the end of any scenes or encounters for the remainder of the session.

The most basic are simple nose plugs which filter out contaminants; there are also higher quality items such as wearable face masks with gas canisters, filtration masks for poisonous atmospheres, and even aquatic rebreathers for sustained activity underwater.

[P]The Gandorthral Atmospherics Roamer-6 is a fairly simple variant stored aboard many starships that filters harmful atmospheres and provides additional gases to produce a proper oxygen-nitrogen mix. Other variants (especially those made for alien species who must spend long periods of time in hostile atmospheres) can be more unobtrusive or comfortable to wear, but essentially do the same thing.

[P]Breathing aids can be set to provide nearly any atmosphere, although oxygen-nitrogen atmospheres are the most common. Some variants of Gand, however, use rebreathers to inhale an ammonia mix that mimics the atmosphere of their home planet.

      [H3]"Quickflash" Burning Gel[h3]

Burning gel is an electrochemical hull-breaching agent synthesized and sold by the Corellian Chemical Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Chiewab Amalgamated Pharmaceuticals. Colloquially referred to as the "shipwright's spare key," burning gel is used to gain access to doors, hatchways, and machine compartments that have been rendered inaccessible. When applied, it quickly burns through nearly any substance, in any environment, including the vacuum of space. It is commonly used to cut holes in starships that are derelict or otherwise damaged and adrift in space and is quite popular among salvage outfits, archaeologists, and other less savory characters. Unlike cutting torches and welders, it emits no flame and requires no oxygen to operate, making it preferable for use in a vacuum.

[P]The gel itself consists of two parts: a stable, extremely caustic acid suspended in a clear gel that adheres to nearly any substance and a pair of thin electrodes. Both parts are contained in a dispenser unit that includes a refillable tank of gel and electrode wire, a tiny power generator, and a pistol-grip applicator. When the applicator trigger is squeezed, a measure of gel is released from the applicator along with the wires contained within. Once the desired amount of burning gel has been applied, the power generator is activated, running a quick, high-powered charge through the gel and activating the acid, which immediately begins eating away at whatever it's been applied to.

[P]For rules purposes, exposure to burning gel deals damage to materials and sentient beings as if it were a weapon. It deals 10 damage and has the Burn 5 and Pierce 5 weapon qualities. Using burning gel requires no skill check. However, placing it correctly and effectively might, at the Game Master's discretion, require a Mechanics check.</Description>

      [H3]CN-15 Camouflage Netting (Roll)[h3]

This sophisticated and versatile camouflage is used by military personnel to conceal encampments, supply caches, vehicles and other high-value assets. Fabritech CN-15 Camouflage Netting contains photoreactive fibers that enable it to match the visual profile of its surroundings, as well as jamming circuitry that offers an effective countermeasure against standard sensor sweeps.

[P]CN-15 Camouflage Netting adds automatic [FA][FA] to all checks made to detect items concealed by it. One roll of netting can conceal one object up to silhouette 2, two rolls can conceal one object up to silhouette 3, and three rolls can conceal one object up to silhouette 4. Anything silhouette 5 or larger is too large to conceal by camo netting alone.</Description>

      [H3]BPEA-1A Cascader[h3]
Developed by Coruscant-based boutique electronics
firm Farbreini MicroElectronics Ltd., the BPEA-IA Cascader
was designed to give those who live in the public
eye an extra level of control over their appearance. A
relatively simple and elegant piece of electronic wizardry,
the Cascader is a small, low-powered holoprojector
connected to a patented projection matrix called
the electronic molecular excitation net (EME Net).
The projector is typically built into a piece of jewelry
or, in the case of models used by military officers, into
medals or decorations on a dress uniform. The EME
Net is a lightweight, unobtrusive mesh of photoreceptors
and photoreactive materials sewn into specially
prepared clothing, such as uniforms and fancy dress
outfits. When activated, the Cascader creates a subtle
holographic effect that enhances both the features and
voice of the wearer, increasing charisma and attractiveness.
It allows wearers to tweak the shape of their face
and the positions of their features, change the color
of their eyes, adjust the tone and texture of their skin,
alter the tenor of their voice, and make a number of
other small adjustments to their appearance.
[P]When wearing a Cascader, a PC upgrades all Charm,
Deception, and Leadership checks he makes once.

These lifesaving but nightmarish devices, known as "brain cages," are designed to preserve the viability of the central nervous system in critically injured patients. The IRAPS is a full-face helmet with IV lines injected into the large vessels of the patient's neck. The blood circulating in the patient's brain is replaced with a hyper-oxygenated nutrient solution, and thermal circuits in the helmet apparatus reduce cranial temperature to provide critical metabolic stabilization.

[P]A cerebral stabilizer must be applied to a patient within one round of suffering a Critical Injury. This device may be applied to a character suffering from a Bleeding Out or The End is Nigh Critical Injury, or a character who has died during the current round. Applying the device requires an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Medicine check[b]. Once applied, the character is stabilized. If he died, he is brought back to life and counts as suffering a Gruesome Injury critical Injury (and all of its effects). Otherwise, his critical injury effects are canceled, though he still suffers from the injury itself.</Description>

By weighting the cubes slightly, unscrupulous individuals can increase the chances of the cubes coming up either red or blue.

      [H3]Chem Lure[h3]

Similar to the beast call, the Beastmaster Chem Lure by CorChemCo is designed to attract beasts to a place where they can be easily captured or killed. However, where the beast call uses sound and recording technology, the Beastmaster does so through the use of pheromones. Small and easy to conceal (around the size of a typical datapad), the Beastmaster contains an exhaustive database listing the genetic codes of most known species in the galaxy. With the creature database and an onboard testing and recording suite that contains a DNA sequencer and a chemical synthesizer, the Beastmaster can create nearly any pheromone, musk, or other biological secretion. It can also be programmed with new DNA if it is provided with a physical sample such as blood, hair, skin, or bone.

[P]To use, a hunter first chooses his creature from the database or creates a new entry with a sample. Then he simply conceals the chemical lure, retreats to an upwind location, and settles in to wait. The Beastmaster uses the DNA information stored in the database to synthesize the correct chemical, aerosolizes it, and then slowly releases it over the course of one standard hour. The synthetic pheromones are incredibly hard for a targeted beast to resist, and the Beastmaster typically has a better chance of luring in its prey than a beast call or other apparatus.

[P]Creatures targeted by the Beastmaster must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Discipline check[b] to resist, otherwise they come as quickly as possible to investigate. These items are often used with electro-snares or other live-trapping equipment to capture exotic animals alive for use as pets, zoo animals, and research subjects. Using the Beastmaster does not require a skill check, although placing it in the best position might, at the Game Master's discretion, require a Survival check.</Description>

Where there are people wishing to communicate, there are people wishing to prevent it, and thus there are jammers. Smaller versions can shut out local signals, while others are so powerful as to cut entire planets off from the rest of the galaxy. The Miradyne "Hail" is one of the former, a relatively portable device that can blanket standard comlink frequencies over a quarter-kilometer radius. It can also focus on a single target (such as an individual building) from up to three kilometers away.

[P]Cutting through the noise created by a comm jammer requires a Computers check, with a difficulty proportional to the distance from the jammer and the power of the device. The closer and more powerful the jammer, the harder the difficulty. The "Hail" forces an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) check[b], which becomes more difficult at close ranges (the exact difficulty is up to the GM, but should increase to Hard or Daunting if at medium range or closer to the device).

Nearly every person and vehicle carries a comlink or a transceiver. While most are encrypted at some level—particularly military grade gear—sophisticated sensory apparatuses can detect the act of sending a signal, regardless of its content. If a system is able to identify the transceiver codes from a particular device, that unit can be accurately traced over a great distance, even if the contents of its messages cannot be decrypted.
[P]Military organizations mount complex and sophisticated com-scans on their capital ships, which are capable of tracing signals even across subspace. More compact eversions, with substantially more limited capabilites, however, may be installed in smaller vehicles, including speeders. These are of greater interest to independent operators, who might need to track the movements of an individual or vehice.
[P]Using a com-scan, a character can triangulate the location and movement of a known comlink or transceiver with an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Computers check[b]. The device functions out to close range on planetary scale. Prevailing atmospheric conditions or excessive background signals can reduce its efficacy.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]Concealed Escape Kit[h3]
Concealed escape kits have everything an individual needs to escape most temporary and short-term internments. Hidden in a false heel of a shoe, boot, or other suitably bulky footwear, a concealed escape kit includes a number of miniature tools designed to help an agent open locks and escape holding cells. A typical kit includes a small pair of wire cutters, a durasteel file, a length of slicewire, a miniature mem-stik containing maps of the area in which the agent is operating and other important information about the region, and a tiny, single-use laser cutter. Most kits also include a thin, flexible monoknife hidden length-wise in the footwear's sole.
[P]The gear hidden in a concealed escape kit upgrades the ability of all Mechanics and Skulduggery checks made to escape confinement once. The laser cutter works for a single round before its energy cell burns out, which is usually just enough time to destroy a mechanical lock or cut a metal bar out of a window or cell door. The flexible monoknife included in the kit has the following profile: (Melee; Damage + 1; Critical 3; Range (Engaged); Pierce 1). Upgrade the difficulty of checks to detect a concealed escape kit twice.</Description>

A surreptitiously captured moment can be turned into evidence that wins wars, topples governments, or simply persuades a certain person to remain silent. Many corporations and investigative groups have produced a wide range of specialized recorders that can be effectively hidden. Although usually made to capture full-color hobos and audio, sometimes such devices capture flat-screen images or audio only, depending on the needs of the user. These miniature recording devices can be installed in an innocuous item, such as a light fixture or chronometer, and left to record until retrieved by the operator. Simple programming optimizes data storage, pausing recording when no activity is detected.

While life is usually controlled and comfortable, there are many times when physical survival becomes an issue. A forced landing might strand a crew deep in Tatooine's deserts, or a speeder failure could result in extended durations in glacial snow. Most ships, especially smaller ones such as fighters and escape pods, contain kits to help ensure survival until rescue or repair. Pretormin Environmental (a company specializing in exploration and survival gear) makes a popular model of survival kit small enough to fit into an escape pod or snubfighter. Their contents include a thermal cloak, multipurpose knife, distress beacon, two emergency comlinks, wire spool, ration bars, basic medpac (equivalent of the GLiS Emergency Medpac), two respirators, water filter and jug, glow rod, 50 meters of high strength microfiber, ten ration packs, and a flare gun. Some pirates would augment their kits with compact blasters or other weapons, knowing that often their enemies will also be eagerly searching for them, although Pretormin Environmental doesn't equip their kits with weapons as standard.

    <Description>[H3]Cyanoxis D-570[h3]
Cyanoxis D-570 was originally developed by Toxico as an all-purpose rodenticide. An extremely aggressive anticoagulant, D-570 works by weakening the walls of a creature's small blood vessels. This causes them to rupture, leading to internal hemorrhaging and eventually death. Thanks to its particular and well-guarded chemical makeup, D-570 works on numerous species throughout the galaxy, a very rare quality in a vermin-killing poison. Spies and assassins began to capitalize on this shared toxicity not long after the poison first appeared on the market.
[P]When used as an assassination tool, D-570 is typically administered through food and drink. Once ingested, the poison takes about a week to break down a sentient being's circulatory system and cause internal bleeding. During that time, the target is fatigued, bruises easily, and often bleeds slightly from the nose, mouth, or ears. Death typically results in ten days or fewer. Since death occurs so long after first exposure, it is often difficult to determine that D-570 was the cause of an individual's death. By the time a week has passed, there is little evidence left, and the assassin can be halfway across the galaxy and out of reach of punishment.

BioTech Industries is a leading supplier of cybernetic devices across the galaxy, and its Mod V and Mod VI cyberarms are made to fit hundreds of alien species. These cyberarms are designed for increased strength (in the case of the Mod V) or manual dexterity (in the case of the Mod VI). Although intended to replace limbs lost in accidents, BioTech sees plenty of sales to those who don't mind replacing their arms with mechanical equivalents.

[P]The Mod V Cyberarm provides + 1 Brawn, while the Mod VI provides + 1 Agility. If a character replaces both arms with cybernetic enhancements, he must use the same model, as they are designed to work in tandem. However, the modifiers from both arms do not stack.

Implanted in the palm and fingers of the user (or incorporated into prosthetic hands) and linked to the user's brainstem, the cybernetic avionics interface allows a pilot to connect with his airspeeder or starship's avionics and flight control systems at a digital level. While interface doesn't eliminate the need for manual control of a vessel, it does significantly improve a pilot's reaction time and help provide instantaneous feedback from the ship's computer.

[P]A character with a cybernetic avionics interface and at least 1 rank in Piloting (Planetary) or Piloting (Space) gains + 1 to the appropriate Piloting skill when flying a starship or airspeeder. The avionics in speeders, swoops, and other repulsorcraft are generally too primitive to interface with, but a player may do so at the GM's discretion if the vehicle is equipped with a particularly advanced flight control computer.</Description>

Some smugglers go to great lengths to conceal valuable cargo, including hiding it in their own bodies. While smuggling goods and spice strapped to the body or swallowed for later retrieval is not uncommon, some smugglers have found it expeditious to move goods inside small containers surgically implanted into their bodies or even incorporated into cybernetic limbs. While a full body search or holoscan might reveal the presence of a cybernetic cavity, it is practically unnoticeable on casual inspection and is likely to be missed by many scanners.

[P]A cybernetic cavity provides 1 rank of the Hidden Storage talent (see page 137 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rulebook). A character with this cybernetic can use the Hidden Storage talent to conceal items within his own body.

A cybernetic disguise implant is composed of a series of systems embedded beneath an individual's skin. These systems allow their users to drastically change their appearance. An extremely invasive, and expensive, full-body implant, a cyber disguise includes a number of systems that can change a being's facial features, skin color, skin texture, hair length and color, eye color, and other surface physical traits. Perfect for infiltrators and deep-cover agents, a cyber disguise can help an agent blend into a crowd, take on a different identity, and even impersonate specific individuals, given enough study and preparation.
[P]A cyber disguise gives a character all the advantages of a standard disguise kit. In addition, it grants users two ranks in the Indistinguishable talent. Changing general features—for example, changing eye color, altering hair color, or growing a beard—takes one to three rounds. More involved disguises can take minutes or hours to perfect. To take on the appearance of a specific individual, a cyber disguise user must make a thorough study of the subject, then make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Deception check[b] to set the disguise. A cyber disguise cannot change a being's general shape or size, add or subtract limbs, or allow an individual to impersonate a member of another species. At the Game Master's discretion, a cyber disguise could be used to impersonate species that are very similar to the user's; a human could impersonate a Chiss or Pantoran, for example.</Description>

Virtually every adult Gank has one of these implants, which allows them to coordinate their actions with unparalleled efficiency.

[P]Characters with Gank comm implants can communicate silently with each other at ranges of up to several kilometers. Since these implants do not use audible information exchange, they cannot be used to communicate with a normal comlink. Likewise, due to the unique nature of these devices, it is virtually impossible for anyone without the implant to listen in on others' comm implant communications, though comm jammers can disrupt their signals. The messages sent via Gank comm implants are not auditory, so effectively communicating requires the users to share a language.

      [H3]Repli-Limb Prosthetic (limb)[h3]

Given the often violent nature of the galaxy and the dangerous weapons used to settle many disagreements, many losers (and winners) of such conflicts often wind up with fewer fingers, arms, or legs than when they started. Others might have internal organs destroyed or ruined eyes. While cloning technology and flesh regenerators can be used to repair such losses, few use this option, as it is expensive and often highly illegal. Instead, many opt for mechanical replacements.

[P]BioTech Industries' Repli-Limb Prosthetic Replacements are some of the more popular options. These cybernetics are designed to provide identical functionality to the original limb or organ, and are installed with a synthflesh covering, making them almost indistinguishable from the organic component they replace.

[P]Limbs and major organs (including sensory organs such as eyes and ears, as well as heart, lungs, livers, and more) can all be replaced with a Repli-Limb option. They do not provide any bonuses or enhancements to the character, but restore him to normality. There are two general cost entries for Repli-Limb Prosthetics; the first is for limbs, the second for organs. However, the GM should feel free to increase or decrease the costs depending on the specific circumstances.

      [H3]Repli-Limb Prosthetic (organ)[h3]

Given the often violent nature of the galaxy and the dangerous weapons used to settle many disagreements, many losers (and winners) of such conflicts often wind up with fewer fingers, arms, or legs than when they started. Others might have internal organs destroyed or ruined eyes. While cloning technology and flesh regenerators can be used to repair such losses, few use this option, as it is expensive and often highly illegal. Instead, many opt for mechanical replacements.

      [H3]Repulsor Fist[h3]

Also called a repulse-hand or an enforcer grip, this durasteel weapon cybernetic is typically neither covered in synthskin nor intended to appear natural. It contains miniature repulsor generators that can be switched on to deliver crushing blows and deflect incoming attacks.
[P]A repulsor grip provides one rank of the Defensive Stance talent and counts as a Brawl weapon with a damage of 8, a Critical Rating of 3, and the Concus-sive 1 and Slow-Firing 2 qualities. This weapon has the Slow-Firing 2 rule, meaning it can only be used once every third round. This means that while a char-acter may still make Brawl attacks when this weapon is "recharging" he does so without any benefits from the weapon—he simply makes an unarmed melee attack.

Certain models are known for making a regular, ominous rasp while others work in deadly silence.

It took six designs before the weaponsmiths at BlasTech achieved success, but the Mod VII, also known as a "blaster arm," finally combined a realistic limb with a deadly ranged weapon. The company uses outsourced cybernetic limbs as the basis for their designs, modifying them with their own proprietary weapon designs to form the final product. Favored by bounty hunters and assassins, the artificial forearm can split open for a short-ranged blaster to spring out and deliver a hail of shots before most foes are aware they are in danger.

[P]The standard cybernetic weapon arm appears to be a regular cybernetic arm but features a retractable light blaster pistol that can be deployed as an incidental. It is attached to the arm and cannot be removed, dropped, or disarmed.

      [H3]CZ-88 Heavy Loader Arm[h3]
The CZ-88 model heavy loader produced by Czerka is a flexible piece of equipment used for everything from moving freaight to collecting salvage to replacing damaged hull plating on starships. The primary loading arm has several extensions that enchance articulation and balance allowing it to handle even delicate materials without sacrificing the lifting power needed for large-scale construction and salvage jobs. It generally comes mounted on a cart witha  repulsorlift as transporting the arm would otherwise be largely impractical due to its enormity.
[P]A heavy loader arm includes a monotask droid brain that can perform checks to heft objects; it has an Athletics skill of 1 and a Brawn of 5 (if unassisted, it rolls [PR][AB][AB][AB][AB] for Athletics checks.
[P]Sometimes, salvagers install loader arms directly onto starships or other vehicles for easy retrieval of scrap metal and other components, using the arm as a low-cost alternative to a tractor beam projector. A CZ-88 heavy loader arm can be installed onto a vehicle of silhouette 3 or larger as an attachment, and uses one hard point. The occupents of the craft can use it to perform Athletics checks to lift objects into or out of the vessel (and other checks at the GM's discretion) without disembarking.

First attributed to the precursors of the Jedi, these objects remain a mystery. At the surface level, Dai Bendu holocrons resemble those produced by the Jedi. Each holocron contains six tracts, subdivided into four lessons apiece. Unlike ones made by the Jedi, Dai Bendu holocrons allow even the most unskilled of Force sensitives access. Their true key to mastery lies in study.
[P]Completing each lesson in the tract requires an amount of study and meditation up to the GM's decision. At its conclusion, the player must roll a Discipline check of one higher difficulty than it took to access that lesson. For example, to complete the first lesson, a Mystic must roll an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Discipline check[b]. To complete the final lesson in a tract requires a [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI]) Discipline check[b].
[P]When a Force-sensitive character completes a tract, the player selects one characteristic. Once per day, they may upgrade the ability dice pool of any single check related to that characteristic by two steps. The player has learned all they can from that tract, and must move on to another.

Data breakers are basic tools of the trade for many slicers. While droid slicers are programmed to crack complex sequences, organics usually lack this innate option, and therefore rely on a data breaker to do the grunt work of opening systems to them so that their true skills can shine once they are inside. Most data breakers are also recording devices, and can pull vast amounts of information from ill-guarded systems in seconds. Droid slicers can choose to have a data breaker (or equivalent systems) installed internally at the same cost. Data breakers add [BO][BO] to any Computers check made to slice computers (as opposed to the usual one for having the right tools for the job).

[P][B]Restrictions:[b] The Empire and many planetary governments restrict possession of data-breaking technology. Military and law-enforcement organizations make legal use of these devices, but typically civilian use of such technology is prohibited.</Description>

Data breakers are common tools used by slicers to force their way into secure systems. Essentially a data battering ram, they are unsubtle tools used for expedience instead of finesse and stealth. Many are also data harvesting devices, recording everything encountered in a system while the slicer roots around for nuggets of information. Most organic Slicers carry one or two of these devices, but droid Slicer Player Characters can have them installed in their internal computer systems as well. Data breakers add [BO][BO] to any Computers check made to slice computers, but they also add [BO] to any attempts to locate use of a data breaker in a computer system due to the "noise" these devices make. Data breakers are highly illegal, and possession or use of one can land a Rebel operative in a maximum security Imperial prison for a very long stay.

Dataspikes, also known as slicers' spikes or computer spikes, are a common tool for bypassing computer security. While expert Slicers sometimes craft advanced examples to break into particular systems, a typical dataspike can be put together to work with any computer. Once installed in a sytem, a dataspike releases a barrage of junk data that overwhlems security, allowing the user a window in which  to access the secured systems. Dataspikes are typically designed to byrn out after use, leaving behind minimal evidence.
[P]Once per round, a character with a dataspike may expend it to attempt to disable a security program as a maneuver (rather than as an action). This can include the use of the Disable Security Program action (see [B]Slicing Encounters,[b]). Reduce the difficulty of the subsequent Computers check to disable the program by 2, to a minimum of [B]Simple (-)[b]. After one use, the dataspike burns out and becomes useless.

      [H3]Death Sticks[h3]

Death sticks are an unpleasant creation derived from the balo mushroom of the planet of Balosar and distributed in a liquid form in distinctive small red and yellow rods. Though the drug is only mildly hallucinogenic, death sticks are well-named; the active ingredient, Ixetal Cilona, is highly addictive and deleterious to one's health. Each dose tears away an ever-greater portion of one's life while simultaneously tightening the grip of addiction. Death sticks are illegal for obvious reasons, and more than a few smugglers who happily deal in spice or illicit arms avoid running shipments of this particular drug on what they term "moral grounds." Use of death sticks also weakens a person's connection to the Force temporarily, though few users or even dealers are aware of this fact.

[P]Death sticks have a nasty result in the long run, but unless one's campaign runs over the course of decades or a character has had a death stick addiction for some years already, characters are unlikely to experience the truly miserable death these drugs bring about. A life-long addiction to death sticks typically halves the lifespan of most species, though various species are more or less susceptible to the effects of Ixetal Cilona. The short-term effects of a single dose last for one scene or combat encounter and adds [SE] to any task the character attempts, and may reduce the character's connection to the Force in certain ways at the GM's discretion.

[P][B]Restrictions:[b] Death sticks are controlled substances on most worlds, and at the very least those under the age of majority cannot purchase them. Death sticks are completely illegal on many other worlds, especially those with high health standards.</Description>

Having been worn by these adepts for generations, some demon masks have become imbued with the dark side of the Force, and grant their wearers certain powers.

[P]A Force-sensitive character wearing a demon mask increases his wound threshold by 2 while he is a dark side Force user. Furthermore, characters making Discipline checks to resist fear caused by a character wearing a demon mask add [SE] equal to that character's Force rating.</Description>

      [H3]Destro-6 Demolition Charge[h3]
These shaped detonite charges are favored for sabotage missions and clandestine raids: situations with hardened targets but limited actual fighting. Setting up the charges takes time and precision, although a sufficiently confident demolitionist can speed matters up by disabling certain safeties. Once in place, charges can be detonated via timer, with delays of up to six hours, or by a remote signal. Properly placed charges are capable of incapacitating armored vehicles or blasting major breaches in a fortification.
[P]Setting up one or more Destro-6 charges with the safeties fully engaged requires an [B]Easy ([DI]) Mechanics[b] check and takes five minutes per charge. Disabling the safeties for a batch of charges halves the time required, but increases the difficulty of the check to [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI])[b]. The GM may spend [TH][TH][TH], or [DE] on any Mechanics check using charges with disabled safety features to cause a premature detonation.
[P}When a charge detonates, it deals 20 damage with the Breach 1 quality to every character and vehicle within short range. Each additional charge used increases the base damage by 5.</Description>

Produced by SoroSuub after the original manufacturer (Serv-O-Droid, Inc.) went out of business, the 87-RM is an independent droid unit designed to aid frontier biologists and botanists in locating and capturing new and exotic biological specimens.

[P]The 87-RM resembles a large (2.5 meters high) box, hovering off the ground on repulsorlifts. This boxy form is necessary; the 87-RM's guts contain a cryogenic cubical storage container large enough to hold—and flash-freeze into cryogenic hibernation—a Tatooine dewback. The 87-RM grabs stunned specimens with its heavy-lifting servo-arms and places them inside the container for freezing and transport.</Description>

[P]The Wanderer Scout Surveyor is a slightly smaller (roughly human sized) droid with a spherical body and up to eight spidery legs. Their design allows for remarkable speed and agility, enabling them to track targets and incapacitate them with a powerful stun blaster. Once unconscious, the 87-RM swoops in to gather the specimen. A single 87-RM usually carries one to three Wanderers, and the droids can work in concert to herd and track down their prey.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]AC1-series Surveillance Droid[h3]
Cybot Galactica's AC1-series surveillance droids are among the most ubiquitous droids in the galaxy. Also known as "Spy Eyes," AC1-series droids are spherical droids just under a meter across, equipped with a low-output repulsorlift generator and packed full of sophisticated imaging and observation systems. Standard units carry a 360-degree holocam with a powerful holotransceiver designed to stream live footage to a remote operator's holodisplay. They also carry a multi-optic imaging package with passive low-light, thermal imaging, infrared, ultrasonic, digital optical, X-ray, and various other sensors. Further, they are equipped with a turret-mounted light blaster pistol for defensive and security purposes.
[P]These droids are quite unintelligent and are programmed with little personality or initiative. A security officer who is in charge of patrol groups of AC1 droids usually pilots them remotely via a control board and voice commands. When left to their own devices, Spy Eyes patrol their given routes and make regular reports to their controller If an AC1 detects intruders, it alerts its controller and then follows the intruders at a distance, recording and observing their movements until a security team can arrive. The Imperial military makes heavy use of these droids, which can be found in nearly every base, camp, installation, and space station under Imperial control. Recently, Alliance intelligence agents discovered that, thanks to a previously unknown exploit in their programming, AC1 droids can be sliced into and taken control of remarkably easily.</Description>

The Rim Securities AC Law Enforcement Droids are a relatively new entry to the field of police automata, envisioned as direct competitors to both Cybot Calactica's HXZ-1 series and SoroSuub's recently released 501-Z series LEO droid. Nearly two meters tall, these broad shouldered humanoid droids are of average intelligence and possessed of a stern, imposing disposition. Programmed for both standard policing as well as fast response riot control duties, AC series droids are covered in imposing plate armor. Their heads have a single horizontal red band for a photoreceptor and they have only the merest hint of other facial features. Their personality matrix seems to have been programmed with the essence of every hard-nosed, uncompromising, "strike first and ask questions later" law officer in history. They are loud, brash, and skilled at physical intimidation. Their grating manner and their tendency to use overwhelming force in inappropriate situations has led to numerous complaints against both the droids and Rim Securities. While civilians may despise the AC series droids, law enforcement agencies throughout the Outer Rim love them for their brutal efficiency, and they are slowly cornering the market for police droids at the edge of the galaxy.</Description>

Legions of them formed the Separatist armies during the Clone Wars but the intervening years have not been kind to their design, which was inexpensive to begin with. Although no reputable military still employs these droids in number, they can be found in limited quantities in the forces of crime lords, mercenaries, and various other ne'er-do-wells throughout the underbelly of the galaxy.</Description>

Industrial Automaton's ASP-19 was a popular sparring droid among Jedi during the waning years of the Republic. Developed from ASP-series labor droids, the ASP-19 is a surprisingly capable melee fighter equipped with a sophisticated combat computer that can be programmed to approximate different Jedi fighting styles. In addition, the difficulty of the ASP-19's training routines can be adjusted up or down to better match the abilities of the trainee. The Jedi Order used these droids for training Jedi of all levels, from the greenest Padawan to the most venerated Jedi Master, and they were ubiquitous at the order's various temples and training facilities. While they were relatively simpleminded and programmed with subroutines that prevented them from killing, ASP-19s were occasionally pressed into service to protect their temples.
[P]ASP-19s are tall, burly constructs with broad shoulders and long limbs. Standing just over two meters tall, they are deceptively quick and possess a raw strength born out of their labor droid roots. Unlike typical battle droids, the ASP-19 is optimized for up-close, hand-to-hand combat instead of ranged fighting. To that end, they are equipped with a retractable vibroblade in one arm and a training lightsaber in the other. What little personality they have is limited to discussion of fighting forms and spouting platitudes about the dignity and honor of dueling. Since they were discontinued nearly four decades ago, ASP-19s are extremely rare and are often destroyed on sight by Imperial personnel. Those that survive, like the scattered remnants of the Jedi Order they once served, remain hidden on backwater worlds or in long-lost Jedi temples.</Description>

While they are incredibly deadly to those whom they are set to hunt, assassin droids are equally dangerous to those who create or employ them. These droids simply have no recognition of the value of life, and will destroy anyone or anything in their path if doing so benefits them in some way.</Description>

Many technologies are designed with these sorts of droids in mind, and have sockets to allow a direct interface with the droid. Some ships are even designed with the intent of offloading certain computing functions to an interfaced droid (for example, some starfighters rely on interfaced astromech droids to serve as a navicomputers for hyperspace travel).</Description>

The new All-Terrain Exploration Droid by Cybot Galactica is designed to assist in the exploration and surveying of newly discovered planets. Hailed as one of the most adaptable and competent surveying droids released in recent years, the AT-ED is set to revolutionize the field of planetary exploration. The AT-ED is a nonhumanoid, Class 2 droid built to operate in the harshest, most inhospitable environments. The AT-ED appears at first glance to be a two-and-a-half meter tall version of Kuat's AT-PT Assault Walker. A long, lightly armored trapezoidal chassis perches atop a pair of reverse-articulated legs with broad, round feet and three grasping toes each. Thanks to their drivetrain layout and the precision with which they are engineered, these droids have exceptional balance and are quite adept at traversing rough and broken ground.

[P]The chassis is crowded with sensors, photoreceptors, microphones, and antennae. Mounted to the left side of the chassis is a powerful, long-range light that can zoom or flood its beam and can project light in the visible, infrared, and ultraviolet spectra, and the ride side mounts a blaster for defense.

[P]A full array of audio and visual sensors feed information into the droid's computer while the numerous scientific instruments and topographic-surveying tools monitor and sample air, soil, water, radiation, and dozens of other variables while making detailed three-dimensional maps of the surrounding countryside. They can even coordinate with orbiting ships, sending and receiving telemetry to develop a thorough picture of a newly discovered world and what it has to offer. AT-EDs are expensive to purchase and maintain, and their numerous complex systems need significant attention to keep running. Despite these limitations and their strange, standoffish personalities, AT-EDs are very popular in the Outer Rim.</Description>

The Outer Rim, in particular, is composed of minor, insular communities and cultures that may lay claim to resources, trade routes, or information essential to the success of larger, more Core-oriented entities. Responding to this situation, Industrial Automatons first created the BD10-series droid, specifically intended to assist negotiating parties in dealing with myriad cultures and systems of the less civilized parts of the galaxy.
[P]Programmed with the languages, traditions, taboos, and morays of over a million Rimward civilizations and corporations, the BD10 series is still seen as one of the best choices of companion for anyone seeking to do business in the Outer Rim. With the help of these innocuous droids, any negotiation with a less advanced society will be infinitely easier.

Due to their combat effectiveness, however, most BL0's were repurposed as security droids soon after their initial release.
[P]This droid-scuttling forward on three squat, sturdy legs and with its robust hyperarticulated arms, an array of non-lethal countermeasures, and two long stun whips emerging from its shoulders-made for a terrifying sight to those familiar with it operations. There are still those who prefer the use of the BL0s to more conventional security or combat droids for a wide variety of reasons; especially in the more physical, hardscrabble negotiating environment of the Outer Rim.</Description>

Three smaller, retractable arms with dexterous fingers are mounted in the droid's chest for delicate work or tool manipulation.
[P]Most BT-series droids, especially those that receive regular maintenance and memory wipes, have a very stiff and business-like attitude. BT droids that develop personalities tend to be cavalier and jocular, with a daredevil, risk-taking attitude-especially when dealing with explosives-that makes their colleagues extremely nervous.

Introduced during the days of the Galactic Republic these droids were constucted at the Serv-O-Droid facility on Cyrillia for labor repair, and light construction use. Through out the decades during which the DUM series has been in service these droids have gained an unfortunate reputation as poorly programmed, hapless and clumsy things that are often not worth the trouble of keeping. They are also highly  disposable, thanks to their sheap construction and low price point, most DUM-series droids are simply destroyed or recycled when damaged rather than repairing. Scrapyards throughout the galaxy are littered with the remains of DUM-series droids, and few individuals consider them to have worth at all.
[P]Despite their repuation and common prejudices against them DUM-series droids are quite capable within the narrow range of their abilities DUM-series droids stand roughly one meter high. They have a spindly almost skeletal appearance, with long, thin limbs and agile digits. They have a broad, flared dome-shaped head dominated by a single large, round photoreceptor equipped with multi-spectrum scanners that detect microscopic damage in metals and other solid materials. Designed to work in large packs, they are euipped with a built-in comm system that includes a constant data link allowing groups of the droids to work together more efficiently and effectively without vocal communications. In addition, DUM-series droids can lift and carry weights well out of proportion to their tiny size. When deactivated, DUM-series droids can fold up into rough cubes covered by their broad heads this allows them to be stored and shipped easily. They can also use this mode to protect themselves from danger such as crashing vehicles or falling debris.
[P]While not particularly well liked by the general galactic population or well supported by Serv-O-Droid, DUM-series droids are still a common sight in the galaxy. They are especially popular in the Outer Rim, where their relative strength and mechanical programming make them excellent assistants to poorer shipwrights and vehicel builders. DUM-series droids are also closely associated with Podracing, nearly every Podracing team keeps a stable of these droids to maintain their vehicles and salvage scrap from crashed competitors along racecourses.</Description>

Two powerful, retractable claws are housed in covered bays along the droid's bottom, and it carries a blaster pistol and ion blaster as standard armament. While quite competent despite its low intelligence, a DZ-70's natural zeal and tenaciousness may occasionally lead to the development of an at all costs" mentality if the droid isn't given proper maintenance and regular memory wipes. This means that the droid does everything in its power, including the use of lethal force, to bring a fugitive to justice.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]E522 Assassin Droid[h3]
The E522 is one of the most feared droids operating in the galaxy today. These burly, hard-hitting droids were originally designed during the buildup to the Clone Wars by Techno Union member corporation Baktoid Combat Automata (BCA). Initially part of BCA's successful B-series battle droid line, the E522 was envisioned as a light anti-armor and anti-aircraft unit that would provide heavy support to platoons of B1 and B2 units. They were seen as too expensive and complex to serve as disposable droid soldiers, however, and the project was scrapped in favor of the B2 and B3 battle droid units.
[P]When the Clone Wars finally ended with the destruction of both the Republic and the Separatists, the Techno Union dissolved, and its member corporations either struck out on their own or were brought under direct Imperial control. BCA was one of the companies nationalized by the Empire, and it was immediately slated for breakup. Through the process of BCA's breakup and the selling off of its various assets, all data from the E522 project fell into the hands of Sienar Intelligence Systems. SIS had been working on plans for its own line of combat and assassin droids, and the acquisition of the E522 R&amp;D data was a huge boon to its project. SIS quickly scrapped its in-house project and poured an immense amount of time and money into bringing the E522 project to fruition. Within a year, the first E522s rolled out of SIS's assembly line and straight into the growing unrest leading up to the Galactic Civil War.
[P]As much a front-line combat droid as an assassin unit, the E522 is a massive, hulking construct festooned with heavy weapons and covered in thick, military-grade armor. It has a rounded, diamond-shaped torso with no discernible head, an extremely narrow waist that rotates 360 degrees, and two heavy tank treads covered in armored skirts in place of legs. Two long, multi-jointed arms sprout from armored shoulders and are equipped with a heavy repeating blaster, heavy ion blaster, and rapid-fire needler gun in place of hands. Three smaller arms with highly dexterous hands are mounted low on the droid's torso to take care of fine work, and a mini-missile launcher is mounted to the droid's back. Scattered about the droid's body is an array of sensors, antennae, and photoreceptors that grant the E522 360-degree full-spectrum vision. The vision system, combined with a powerful on-board combat computer and targeting system, makes these droids a terror on the battlefield.
[P]There are currently fewer than one hundred E522 droids operating in the galaxy. Most of these are in active service with Imperial Army Intelligence and the Imperial Security Bureau as assassins and support units for various Imperial black ops. These droids, with their regular memory wipes and maintenance, retain the silent and intimidating personalities that their Sienar programmers gave them. A handful have fallen into the hands of the Alliance, mostly as battlefield salvage. They are serving the Alliance well in roles similar to those in which they served the Empire. E522s in the Alliance have developed gruff, demanding, cynical personalities that agents who work with them describe as "like everyone's least favorite Master Sergeant." Despite this, Alliance E522s are well liked and respected for their bravery and competence in the field.</Description>

      [H3][I]ED-V8[i]-Series Envoy Droid[h3]
[P]Seeing a weakness in the general run of protocol droids, namely the almost universal humanoid appearance of most models, the Rseikharhl Droid Group began the development of a droid who would specialize in assisting negotiators and diplomats working specifically with non-humanoid species. Built around the ancient chassis of a Krath war droid, the ED-V8 uses variable-configuration cybernetics to alter the appearance of its body, while two interface modules supply the foundations for communication with an array of non-humanoid cultures.
[P]The ED-V80 series is programmed to be completely inoffensive and nonthreatening as it assists its owner in establishing contact with local leaders. Programmed with an abnormally high level of autonomy, most droids in this series work as the first point of contact with non-humanoid societies, laying the foundation from which more experienced humanoid diplomats can build.</Description>

      [H3]EG-6 Power Droid[h3]
VeriI Line Systems' EG-6 units are the most common class five droids in the galaxy. Essentially walking fusion reactors, these droids were designed to provide power wherever it is needed. Thanks to being monotask droids, they have little in the way of personality. This is exacerbated by the fact that these droids can only communicate in droid and computer languages.
[P]EG-6 droids have a squat, bipedal form and chassis reminiscent of two ziggurats mounted together at the base. They are surprisingly heavily armored and shielded. A busy control panel full of switches, light power couplings, and a handful of sensor lenses makes up what passes for a face. They do possess a small, meter-long retractable manipulator arm in the center of their front panel; it is rarely used, though, and many owners have no idea the droids have them.
[P]These droids carry a medium fusion reactor good for recharging vehicles or providing power to small buildings or installations. They are also equipped with a powerful sensor suite that includes a spectrometer, a multi-spectral scanner, and a power diagnostics package that allows them to diagnose and repair power systems.</Description>

They are equipped with two manipulator arms and a built-in EOD tool kit that an operator can use remotely to disarm explosive devices. An on-board demolitions scanner can detect explosive compounds and devices to assist the operator in locating hidden demolitions items. They are also equipped with a small demolitions charge to remotely detonate an explosive device should it be impractical or too difficult to disarm. While they are usually operated by a qualified EOD or demolitions operator, EOD-Mk IV remotes can operate autonomously, traveling in groups with preprogrammed orders.</Description>

A highly specialized maintenance droid, fire suppression droids perform the singular function of putting out fires. These droids are particularly useful aboard starships, where fires can quickly burn up the oxygen and cause irreparable damage to a vessel. Generally mounted on tracked chassis or repulsorlifts and fitted with large tanks of chemical fire retardants, fire suppression droids can quickly respond to out-of-control fires raging through a ship and are able to safely work under conditions that would be hazardous or even lethal to organic beings.

[P]Fire suppression droids can be used aboard any vehicle or starship with a silhouette of 4 or larger. However, the larger the vessel, the more droids are needed to adequately protect the vessel from fires. A vessel with a silhouette of 4 may require only one fire suppression droid, while a bulk transport or corvette would need several; a starship the size of an Imperial Star Destroyer would need hundreds of droids to adequately protect its massive bulkheads and kilometers of corridors and access shafts. These droids are able to put out small fires independently.</Description>

    [P]The G2 repair droid is a custom Sullustan design produced by SoroSuub. Intended to assist with shipboard repair, many of these droids instead found themselves utilized as pilots and tour guides for civilian charter vessels. Referred to as “goose droids” due to their widely spaced feet, long necks, and clumsy gait, G2s tend to possess a quirky demeanor and exhibit excessively chatty behavior. Over time, the droids also develop a unique sense of humor, trading witticisms and bad jokes with anyone who takes the time to listen.
[P]Overall, the G2 series droids were appreciated by their owners and the tourists they were charged with. Many G2 owners would relieve their droids of their jobs and keep them around as companions. The series’s downfall, however, lay in the fact that larger corporations considered them a waste of money due to their tendency to talk rather than work.</Description>

Their construction and engineering programming allows these droids to carry out all common functions on a construction site, from basic labor to planning, problem solving, logistical tasks, and supervising other construction droids. They can even interface with VLS's I-C4a combat construction droid and are often used to replace that machine's organic crew.
[P]These droids are overall quietly competent, going about the business of following orders and carrying out construction plans with little fuss. Those that have developed personalities, such as the ones that serve with Alliance engineering units in the field, enjoy working with organics. On a job site, they are quiet and focused, but off the clock they tend to be garrulous and occasionally didactic.</Description>

      [H3]Guardian Police Droid[h3]
GU-series "Guardian" police droids were the primary law enforcement droids operated by the Coruscant Security Force during the final years of the Republic. Designed and built by Cybot Galactica specifically for the CSF, countless thousands of these droids patrolled the sprawling upper levels of Coruscant's Galactic City for generations. While in service, GU-series droids gained a repuation as solid and levelheaded, if unimaginative, law enforcers. They were programmed for various police work, such as patrol, peacekeeping, crime scene investigation, detective work, and riot control. Although they were reliable, the GU-series droids suffered drom a lack of iniative. Clever or dedicated criminals could usually outhink them with little difficulty.
[P]Guardian police droids stand just under two meters tall. They have roughly human proportions, with long dexterous arms powerful legs, and a round head with gold-colored photoreceptors. Their heads are capped with a tall, cap-like structure reminiscent of a shako or kepi, complete with a short brim over their photoreceptors, this structure houses sensors and a powerfil commications suite. The droids are  often painted dark blue with silver and white accents, with a CSF badge painted on their left chest plate. When on patrol, Guardians are typically armed with a BlasTech SS-410 Police Spcial blaster pistol and a simple truncheon. Depending on the situation, they can also be equipped with stun batons, grenade launchers, riot shields, and blaster rifles.
[P] By the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire, most Guardian droids were phased out of operation with the CSF.  Replaced by Stormtroopers and newer-model, more aggressive droids, surplus GU-series droids were sold off to other worlds, reassigned to lower-priority sectors, or simply scrapped. Some can still be found patrolling the lower levels of the Imperial capitol, however. Many of these veteran droids have not had a memory wipe in decades and some have even developed very distinct personalities similar to no-nonsense police officers. They still serve the people of Coruscant, but most are entirely too old and outdated to be carrying out actual police duties.</Description>

A relatively common sight aboard colony ships and in the streets and alleys of countless settlements, Veril Line Systems' Gyrowheel series recycling droid is, in its way, perhaps the most useful and important droid a colony can possess. Using a powerful cocktail of natural and artificial enzymes contained within their bodies, these droids turn garbage, food scraps, and other organic refuse into a nourishing nutrient sludge that can make up the large part of many a colonist's daily caloric intake.

[P]Standing around two meters high, these hard working droids consist of a broad, round body like a high-walled serving platter around 2.5 meters across covered by a retractable clamshell cover. Dexterous manipulator arms ring the droid's body, and a dull red photoreceptor constantly scans its surroundings for trash. The droid's body is perched on a single hard rubber wheel and is kept balanced by a sophisticated gyro-stabilization system. More a remote than an actual sentient droid, these extremely dim-witted constructs are devoid of individual personality beyond a desire to hunt trash. They operate in packs, scouring their surroundings for organic refuse under the command of a central monitoring computer system.</Description>

     [P]Despite its capabilities, the J9 worker drone was an abject commercial failure. Designed as a protocol droid, the series’ moniker, “worker drone,” was deceptive to potential customers, who assumed it was just another labor droid. In addition, the unit's appearance, which was distinctly bug-like, in conjunction with its flat personality, turned many mammalian species off. The Verpine even attempted to market the droid to other insectoid species, still without much success.
[P]Most of the J9 worker drones purchased by the public were placed in labor jobs, wasting their more advanced systems and programming on menial tasks. Because of this, J9s are some of the most intelligent labor droids on the market. Over time, however, they develop somewhat bitter personalities, as they feel they were destined for something greater but were somehow cheated out of it.
[P]The Rebel Alliance has acquired a large number of surplus J9 worker drones directly from Roche and has put them to good use. The Alliance realizes that the J9 is much more than a simple labor droid, and many of the units have been assigned to Rebel teams to assist them with translation and analysis. So far, the majority of these J9s have been a success in the field.

Pilot droids have been a common sight throughout the galaxy for millennia. They are produced in a variety of styles, from the diminutive repulsor-driven RX series to the lanky, skeletal cyclopes of the FEG series, and range from simple automated pilots following preprogrammed routes to highly talented droids capable of flying a snubfighter against Imperial Navy pilots.

[P]The JC series produced by Industrial Automaton takes all of these qualities and turns them on their head. A bipedal, humanoid descendant of the well-respected V-series pilot droids, with which the JC series shares much of its internal systems architecture, these new-style pilot droids are unlike any previously seen on the market. They are brash, aggressive, head-strong droids programmed to be highly competitive in all matters to do with flying starships and atmospheric craft. Whereas a typical pilot droid speaks in a calming baritone and has a steady demeanor, JC-series droids speak in a quick, strong feminine voice full of confidence and swagger.

[P]They were designed initially to act as test pilots and were marketed to shipbuilding and military-contracting concerns such as Incom and KDY. Quite intelligent for a nonacademic droid, the JC series is equipped with powerful and versatile piloting software, a datalink that allows them to connect directly to a ship's internal systems, and upgraded servos, circuits, and myomer-synthetic musculature to make them incredibly agile. While they are not built with direct combat in mind, they are equipped with a pop-up blaster pistol concealed in their right forearm along with the programming to use them, giving these droids some self-defense capabilities. Most of the JC series are still in service with their original buyers, flying small- and medium-sized prototype spacecraft to the limits of their construction and often paying for it with their lives. Those few that found their way into general civilian hands, especially in the Outer Rim, have found their share of work with traders, smugglers, explorers, and other individuals who tend to live exciting and dangerous lives and might need the services of a talented copilot.</Description>

      [H3]Cybot Galactica K-9 Series Hunting Droid[h3]

On the wilder worlds in the Outer Rim, many sentients still stalk the wild beasts of their native lands as their ancestors have done for millennia. While much of this activity, especially on the more primitive worlds, is largely done to put food on the table, there are those hardy individuals for whom it is more a sport and less a necessity. Big-game hunting is big business in the Outer Rim, whether for exotic pets, firs, trophies, rare delicacies, or new chemical compounds and other components valuable to corporations. The men and women who spend their time stalking these creatures often travel with an animal or droid companion.

[P]To aid hunters, Cybot Galactica sells the K-9 series hunting-and-tracking droid. Large, stoutly constructed droids roughly the size of a krayt-dragon hatchling, they have a distinctly canine appearance with their long bodies, wedge-shaped heads, and powerful tails. They are equipped with top-of-the-line sensors that allow them to hear frequencies well outside the ranges of most sentients as well as to see in the dark, perceive thermal emissions, and see over long distances. They are also one of the few droids equipped with advanced olfactory sensors, allowing the K-9 series to track by scent. They have crushing jaws full of sharp teeth, and their feet are equipped with retractable claws to help them take down their prey.
[P]The K-9 series droids are also quite powerful, agile, and cunning, capable of leading other droids or hunting animals in packs. While they are intelligent, their programming and personalities are so focused that they tend to speak, when they speak at all, in clipped sentences punctuated with animal sounds and machine noises.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]LSx-series Slicer Droid[h3]
One of the very few dedicated slicer droids on the market, the LSx-series packs an immense amount of computing power into a small package. A product of the notoriously corrupt and rapacious Loronar Corporation, the I-SX was introduced during the early years of the Galactic Empire as a "programming and computer sciences" droid, marketed toward educational institutions and technology companies. Loronar being Loronar, however, the droid was in fact a dedicated slicer unit geared toward industrial espionage and military intelligence. Along with the aboveboard marketing, Loronar used all of its corporate might to peddle these droids to any law enforcement or government intelligence agency that would take them, including the Empire and various factions within the Rebel Alliance. While the ISB and Imperial military Intelligence agencies demurred, having already signed contracts with Arakyd and MerenData to purchase espionage and slicer droids, the Alliance snapped LSx droids up in bulk to bolster its small intelligence corps.
[P]LSx-series droids are humanoid-shaped constructs just under two meters tall, with spindly limbs and a long, animal-like head reminiscent of Baktoid's old B1 battle droids. They are equipped with cutting-edge slicer gear and powerful programming and data analysis firmware easily rivaling that of most intelligence agencies and criminal organizations. Packed into their hands and bulky forearms is an array of fine manipulators, computer probes, scomp links, circuit chasers, and other electronics and computer repair tools that allow the droids to access anything from a datapad to a military-grade mainframe. Mounted between the knuckles of their right hand, they even carry a scomp-spiker, a highly illegal piece of industrial espionage and sabotage equipment that pours a devastating high-voltage charge through a computer system to destroy both hardware and software. Although they are not programmed for combat, LSx-series droids can defend themselves if necessary, and the scomp-spiker makes for an extremely nasty weapon against both organics and droids.
[P]These droids rarely speak, and when they do it is in a nearly indecipherable patois of technical jargon, acronyms, and academic pedantry. However, LSx-series droids that have gone without regular maintenance and memory wipes often learn to express themselves in ways less likely to bore and drive away colleagues. Some develop obsessive and deeply sarcastic personalities. The Rebel Alliance currently uses the majority of LSx-series droids that have been produced, typically assigning them to base duty where they work endless hours attempting to crack Imperial military network security.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]M4-series Messenger Droid[h3]
Another of Cybot Galactica's popular and well-liked entries into the droid market, the M4-series is perhaps the finest messenger droid currently available. M4-series droids are roughly half a meter tall and have a thin, blocky, pentagonal body with no external limbs and a small, highly secure compartment built into the right side. A large holoprojector lens dominates the front face of the droid, and a small, high-output repulsorlift generator provides propulsion and gives the M4 a surprising burst of speed when needed. As dedicated messenger droids, M4s are equipped with a high-resolution holoprojector and an on-board memory that can store a single message up to five minutes long. M4s also carry a long-range comlink and a sophisticated navigation suite that connects to the HoloNet for real-time travel and navigation information nearly anywhere in the galaxy.
[P]Relatively bright and remarkably clever, M4-series droids were built with one goal in mind: to deliver their message at any cost. To that end, these droids are overbuilt to an almost ridiculous degree. They are packed full of redundant operating systems and triple-secure encryption for their messages. Their bodies are heavily reinforced and fitted with solid armor that can turn shots from light-caliber slugthrowers and low-powered blasters with ease. Their shape and size allow them to squeeze through tiny spaces, and a patented Cybot Galactica stealth subroutine allows these little droids to flit about largely unnoticed when needed. Thanks to their design, sturdy build, and on-board systems, M4-series droids have developed a reputation for successfully delivering their messages no matter how hard the trip, how long it takes, or how much damage they suffer en route.
[P]M4s are rare in Imperial service, as the ISB and other intelligence agencies have their own, bespoke messenger droids in the shape of the familiar MSE-series and AS-MI 2-series droids. A fair number of these sturdy droids have found their way into the Alliance, where they work with intelligence and courier services to run encrypted messages between various Rebel cells. Many M4 droids in Alliance employ take immense pleasure in breaking through various levels of Imperial security to deliver their data. One such droid is even rumored to have broken into an Imperial stockade somewhere in the Outer Rim to deliver a message—and a holdout blaster—to an imprisoned Alliance intelligence agent.</Description>

They can be found anywhere in the galaxy that has the proper technology level to support droids and starports in particular are typically crawling with the things. Maintenance droids generally have a low level of intelligence and are not a threat to organic beings, but malfunctions or malicious reprogramming have been known to turn them against their masters, sometimes with terribly effective results.</Description>

      [H3]MI-Series Security Droid[h3]
Holowan MEchanicals' imposing MI-series security droids are some of the most efficent and dengerous droids in the galaxy. A recent entry into an already crowded security droids field, Holowan made its new droids stand out by arming them to their metaphorical teeth and margeting them heavily among wealthy civilians and small planetary governments. Its plan paid off, and within a scant few years it had a nearly two-year waiting list for new MI-series models.
[P]At first glance, MI-series droids look more like a frontline combat droids than private security units. They stand just over two meters tall and are covered in thick plasteel armor of a type usually found in heavy battel hardsuits and power-assisted armor. They have two heavy duty front legs that end in broad feet, and a small, armored head fitted with two large, red photoreceptors. Their most striking features are the two sets of arms mounted to their torso.
[P]The upper arms, which are mounted to the droid's shoulders, are proportional to the size of the droid. Each of these arm ends in a powerful weapon cluster that includes a pair of light repeating blasters and a pair of short-range stun blasters. The lower arms are huge, seeming much larger than the droid's chassis should be able to support and end in a  pair of massive, powerful hands, each with two fingers  and an opposable thumb. The weapons loadout, multitude of arms, and very aggressive programming with which these droids are equipped makes them incredibly formidable opponents.
[P]MI-series droids have stern humorless personalities and are given to barking orders and making bold declarations. Their voices have a deep, resonant tone that heightens their intimidation factor. They are programmed to close quickly with non-hostiles invading their personal space while warning or ordering them away from some forbidden area. Very few individuals in the galaxy can withstand having a two-meter tall heavily armedm very angry froid looming over them while demanding they leave an area lest the droid open fire. MI-series droids that go for too long without a memory wipe tend to develop distrubing, almost sadistic personality traits and can become unhinged and dangerous without constant upkeep. At least one of these powerful droids, a unit designated MI-726, is known to have gone rogue and taken up a life of anti-Imperial crime.</Description>

[P]Droids can perform in a wide array of functions for diplomats and negotiators across the galaxy, but sometimes, no matter how hostile the environment, only direct contact with a diplomat's counterparts will do. Haor Chall Engineering was seeking to address just this need when it designed the P2F remote. Carrying an extensive suite of sensors, recording devices, and projection equipment, the P2Ds can bring a diplomat's likeness to any client, no matter how inaccessible their sphere of influence.
[P]Although the P2F can be piloted remotely, kept under the complete control of its operator, the units also possess sufficient initiative and awareness to deliver themselves to their assigned area of operation to initiate direct contact. Utilizing a combination of repulsorlift technology and multiple articulated limbs, the P2F can go almost anywhere, providing a secure holoprojector link between the negotiating parties.</Description>

Cybot Galactica, manufacturers of the renowned 3P0-series protocol droids, took a decidedly less human-centric approach to the design of the variant 3PX line marketed to customers in the Outer Rim. Because of the diversity of species throughout the vast region, the droid was designed with a face based on no particular species, but with elements of several prominent groups through a wide swath of the Outer Rim territories. The final result was recognizable to almost every species it encountered, but lacked the ability to connect with specific species as well as a more clearly defined 3P0 model. Sales of the 3PX line suffered as a result, leading to a limited production run. However, resold droids tend to command the price of brand-new droids, thanks to the droid's extensive cultural and linguistic databases. The Rebellion also favors use of 3PX-series droids, seeing them as a symbol that distances the Alliance from the Empire's pro-human sentiment.</Description>

The protocol droids of the 5YQ-series, while perfectly functional mediators, are widely regarded as cheap knockoffs of more popular models. They were produced by Cybot Galactica to compete with Serv-0-Droid Incorporated's near monopoly on sales in the Mid Rim, but the project was not given adequate resources to break into such a diverse market. The 5YQ design team ended up recycling most of the work done on the earlier 3P0-series, but replaced the deep cultural databases previously used with a wide but shallow array of details on every conceivable topic. The final result was a droid that could operate in any part of the galaxy, but with considerably less effectiveness than a more specialized model. Given time, the 5YQ line might have been able to develop a market, but the production lines were shut because of a lawsuit against Cybot Galactica for using Serv-O-Droid parts in the 5YQ-series. This was the final black mark for the line, leaving them with a market share far lower than their relatively unremarkable performance would merit.</Description>

The CZ-series communications/business droid exemplifies extreme specialization in protocol droid manufacture. Its databanks feature a suite of languages and cultural customs smaller than comparable models, and it lacks information on species or cultures beyond the Core Worlds. Instead, the CZ-series is programmed with a near-complete database of banking and financial regulations, as well as storage space to record current market prices for any goods it might encounter. A long-range comlink enables the droid to observe markets across a whole planet or to access interstellar communications networks to track deals made throughout the galaxy. The model's one universally reviled downside is the standard paintjob, designed to draw attention to the droid in dealerships. It is a truly vulgar mix of bright green and orange—obviously, many owners have these droids repainted.

[P]Although the Rebellion has limited need for the business acumen the CZ-series is built for, the droids are top-notch negotiators, often capable of reaching settlements solely on the strength of their programming. Furthermore, the droid's long-range comlink can serve as a distress beacon or homing device for Rebel cells in negotiations with groups of dubious trustworthiness.</Description>

When Industrial Automaton entered the protocol droid market with the LOM-series, they gambled on an unusual strategy. Rather than compete directly with the dominant Cybot Galactica for the core of the market, they released droid designed for a more niche buyer. The LOM-series has oversized optical sensors reminiscent of compound eyes and other insectoid facial features designed to maximize appeal with similarly-featured alien species such as the Gand and Verpine. The LOM-series was a huge success, earning Industrial Automaton not only customers from that market but also among those who frequently do business with insectoid species.

[P]As a gesture of goodwill, the Rebellion often employs LOM-series droids when working with insectoid species. However, the LOM-series is perfectly functional in any circumstance requiring a protocol droid, so they are often assigned to assist Alliance representatives, regardless of the species involved.</Description>

Envoy droids fill an obscure but significant niche in the protocol droid market. Programmed for greater independence of thought than most and featuring expanded loyalty protocols, envoy droids are able to speak in their master's stead without supervision. While there are entirely legitimate uses of droid envoys, sending one is nevertheless considered a snub in most circles—usually taken to indicate that the droid's master considers his opposite number to be untrustworthy or unworthy of a direct meeting. Nevertheless, the Rebellion often risks the hard feelings, taking the opportunity to conduct negotiations without risking the lives of its agents by deploying LRD-series droids to suspect meetings whenever possible.
[P]The LRD-series is one of the few envoy droids that receives a measure of respect when sent to a meeting. The droid's mimic circuits allow it to imitate its master with astounding precision. Having an LRD-series envoy at negotiations is considered nearly the same thing as having its master present; given the price of the model, it is generally not taken as harshly to see one arrive instead of a flesh-and-blood negotiator.</Description>

An M-3P0 military protocol droid manages logistical and analytical efforts for soldiers. Its chassis is better protected than a typical protocol droid, and it is programmed for military discipline in all situations. However, the M-3P0-series cannot withstand the rigors of actual combat. An M-3P0 unit is best deployed inside a secure installation where it can access tactical data or manage communications. The droid uses its encyclopedic knowledge of military protocols, tactics, and doctrines to assist nearby personnel. A commander with an M-3P0 advisor gains the edge of keen, dispassionate logic, while a quartermaster assisted by a similar aide always knows how to efficiently supply troops. M-3P0 units are sticklers for obeying whatever regulations apply to the group they are serving. and they are notoriously inflexible.</Description>

The TC-series, produced by Cybot Galactica, is less widely known than the more affordable 3P0 models from the same manufacturer, but it remains one of the most highly regarded lines of protocol droids. Officially registered as a variant line on the more common 3P0 models, the TC-series is actually a solid upgrade in most aspects. The differences are not apparent to the casual observer, as the two droids are nearly identical visually. Instead, the improvements of the TC-series lie in two key areas of programming. First, TC units have benefited from increased design attention, giving them more stable and helpful personalities after some 3P0-series droids were reported to develop eccentric and grating personalities. Secondly, and perhaps more significantly, the TC-series is equipped with a more advanced version of the TranLang It communications module used throughout the protocol droid market. While almost any protocol droid is programmed with a vast array of languages and the capacity to decipher new ones with impressive speed, the TC-series excels above its competitors. The TranLang variant used in these droids uses adaptive programming to improve the unit's grasp on a language throughout a conversation, enabling them to attempt communication after only a few words spoken by a new species or culture.</Description>

[P]Referred to as “mole droids” by the miners who use them, Q-4s possess a cheerful demeanor and pursue their work with apparent glee. Despite their carefree and can-do attitudes, Q-4s aren’t particularly bright, and they often bite off more than they can chew if left unattended for long periods of time.

      [H3]Q7-Series Astromech Droid[h3]

The Q7 was the result of a joint venture between Industrial Automaton and Kuat Systems Engineering. Designed specifically for use in KSE's A3 Nimbus short-range interceptor, the Q7 is unique among IA's astromech droid catalog in both construction and personality. Using design specifications and access to the Nimbus' advanced new software architecture, IA developed its new droid specifically for use in the new fighter, a process that both companies felt would be a growing trend in the near future. After numerous failed prototypes, IA finally perfected the interface systems and the brand new Q7 was revealed along with the Nimbus to overwhelming praise from both the military and civilian sectors.

[P]Unlike any of Industrial Automaton's astromech droids on the market at that time, the Q7 is as visually striking as it is competent. Combining the sensor dome of an R2-series with a lower hemisphere containing a miniaturized repulsorlift generator, the Q7 is a perfect alloy sphere roughly one meter across at its widest. The droid's body style was dictated by the size of the Nimbus, which is an incredibly tiny fighter, and the locations in which designers could find space. The ability to go anywhere, anytime, and to get itself into and out of its droid socket with no outside assistance was one of the Q7's biggest selling points, and one that played very well with those interested in military logistics and planning. The droid's programming and its ability to interface so seamlessly with the A3 was touted as the next step in astromech droid development. Many thought that having a droid built specifically for a given ship represented a significant step forward, as it meant that the droid and the craft could work in perfect tandem. The positive buzz around the Q7 lasted right up until the Republic Navy took delivery of the A3 fighters and their attendant droids, and then some ugly truths became quickly apparent.

[P]As the Republic Navy became more familiar with the Q7 and its quirks, it became clear that the little droid was drastically limited in both scope and utility. The fact that it was built solely for the Nimbus meant that, while it was quite good at operating that fighter, thanks to its size, shape, and bespoke programming the A3 was the only fighter with which it worked well. The Q7 lacked the programming and the hardware to interface with any other ship or vehicle in the Republic Navy inventory, which, compared to the current R2 and R3 series droids, made it unsuitable for most work undertaken by Navy droids, such as the repair and maintenance of ships. In addition, the Q7's personalities, such as they were, were so single-minded and focused on their specific fighters that they were difficult to work with when doing anything other than flying the A3. Aside from their programming and personalities, the droids' repulsorlift system proved to be finicky, high maintenance, and hard to repair in the inevitable event of a break down. All of this added up to make the 07 perhaps the most loathed droid series in IA's history and a black mark on its otherwise sterling reputation.

[P]After the initial run of Q7s were produced for the Navy's A3 fighters, production was ceased and all back stock Q7s were sold at fire sale prices to civilians and local governments throughout the galaxy. With the collapse of the Republic and the rise of the Empire came the retirement of the A3 and the development of the new TIE-series fighters, which also meant retirement for the numerous Q7s in the inventory. Many were simply scrapped with their fighters and either recycled or returned to IA for parting out. Those that survived were typically reprogrammed as well as possible to work as general astromech droids and transplanted into surplus R2 and R3 bodies. Today, it's rare to find a functioning Q7, and even rarer to find one in its original body. Those that are still around are typically found in out-of-the-way places where their low cost and admittedly strong grasp of astromechanics make them an attractive investment.</Description>

The Q-Signal Messenger Drone from Incom is unlike anything on the market today. Essentially a stripped-down starfighter piloted by a savant-level droid brain, the a-Signal drone is designed to deliver encrypted data and physical specimens through hyperspace to predetermined coordinates. Little more than a space-going dead drop facilitator, the single-minded droid brain that controls the vehicle knows nothing more than its current whereabouts and whatever hyperspace coordinates are programmed into its limited-memory navicomputer. Both Imperial and Alliance intelligence agencies use Q-Signal drones in large numbers. They are commonly found aboard patrol and picket ships, but most military starships carry one or two aboard.
[P]To use a Q-Signal drone, an agent simply loads data or cargo aboard the vessel and feeds hyperspace coordinates into the navicomputer. The Q-Signal is then pushed out of a hangar bay or launched from a fighter catapult into space, where it jumps away to make its delivery. When a Q-Signal arrives at its destination, it falls into a low-power mode to wait for pickup. While powered down, the droid keeps itself on station with automated thrusters and a simple passive sensor system. Once it is retrieved and its data or cargo removed, its memory is wiped and it is either put in storage aboard the receiving vessel to await another run or returned to its sender.</Description>

The R7-series is the latest member of Industrial Automaton's highly respected R-series family of astromech droids. Designed specifically for use in the newly released E-wing multi-role starfighter, the R7-series was developed in secret, along with its bespoke starfighter, as part of a joint venture between IA and FreiTek Incorporated.

Using an all-new, highly-advanced droid brain and the latest versions of IA's tried-and-true astromech programming, the R7-series outshines even the venerable R2-series as an astrogator, technician, and starship pilot.

[P]The R7 is an extremely novel design, using few parts or systems from earlier R-series droids. While it still has the iconic R-series barrel-shaped body, domed head, and two outboard legs with broad, treaded feet, that's where the resemblance to its older cousins ends. The internal systems of the R7 are all new, and its power and computer systems are heavily shielded using circuit-hardening technology typically found in starfighters. The droid's chassis is reinforced and constructed from stronger and lighter alloys than previous models. The triangle-shaped sensor eye is packed with advanced optical sensors that allow the droid to see in nearly any light as well as scan and analyze materials and structures for microfractures and stress fatigue. R7s are programmed with an eager, can-do personality that stands in stark contrast to the strange and surly personalities exhibited by their R5 predecessors.
[P]Unfortunately, despite all their advanced systems and genial personalities, the capabilities of the R7 series are limited. While they enjoy incredible synchronicity between their systems and the systems of the new E-wing starfighters for which they were designed, R7s find it difficult or even impossible to interface with older starfighters. Even the vaunted X-wing's systems are too slow and dusky for an R7 to use fully. R7s can be programmed to interface with other starfighters, but their compatibility can never be one hundred percent. In game terms, this means that when connected with any starfighter or other vessel that isn't an E-wing, an R7 loses the benefits of its Galaxy Mapper and Hold Together talents.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]RA-7 Protocol Droid[h3]
The RA-7 series is the Galactic Empire's go-to choice for protocol and espionage droids. Arakyd Industries designed and produced this series in the years leading up to the Clone Wars in an ambitious but ultimately failed attempt to compete with Cybot Galactica's ubiquitous 3PO-series protocol droids. RA-7s are gawky, awkward-looking droids just under two meters tall, with spindly limbs, a head reminiscent of a Verpine's, and huge, bulbous photoreceptors that take up the majority of their face. Their personalities are, on the whole, dull and dry with an air of aloofness that few owners find tolerable. RA-7s that have gone without regular maintenance and memory wipes tend to be morose, pessimistic, and constantly exasperated with everyone and everything around them.
[P]The RA-7 line's great failure, which ended Arakyd's plans for further expansion in the protocol droid market, is the fact that the droids offer nothing unique to their buyers. Their etiquette and protocol programming is respectable, and their ability to analyze and collate data is actually quite remarkable, but there is nothing they do that Cybot Galactica's 5POs can't do cheaper, better, and more reliably. After years of dwindling sales and tens of thousands of unsold units, Arakyd canceled the line and offered its entire back stock to the Imperial armed forces at fire-sale prices. Only the ISB took Arakyd up on its offer, and only then, through modification and reprogramming, did the RA-1s find purpose.
[P]The ISB thoroughly overhauled the thousands of RA-7s it purchased, installing new programming and upgrading the droids' sensor package. Each droid received a sophisticated intelligence-gathering system that included active and passive listening devices and multi-optic, high-resolution photoreceptors with numerous vision modes and the ability to record and transmit audio, video, and holographic data. A constant-on uplink to the ISB's secure HoloNet was installed to give RA-7s constant access to the ISB's expansive databases and to ensure the droids can upload the information they collect as they go about their business. All of these systems are cleverly hidden in plain sight throughout the droid's chassis, and the espionage programming looks like innocent etiquette and protocol subroutines when examined.
[P]Once they were modified, the ISB deployed their RA-7 droids throughout the Imperial armed forces to keep tabs on Imperial personnel and root out criminals and traitors. Nearly all RA-7s currently active are in Imperial service. Very few have defected to or been stolen by the Alliance; those that have are considered to be nearly priceless thanks to their espionage and intelligence-gathering equipment and their knowledge of ISB protocols. Some models found other roles to play in the Rebellion. One RA-7, for example, escaped ISB reprogramming and served as an inventory specialist in one of the more infamous Rebel cells.</Description>

      [H3]RH-Series Research Droid[h3]
RH-series research droids are a small-run series of science droids produced by Cybot Galactica. A variant of the company's 2R-series medical droid, they were designed to act as a combination research assistant and walking database for field scientists on research missions. Only a few thousand of these droids were produced, as they proved unpopular in the scientific community. Most of those produced are still active, though. They are commonly found working in farflung laboratories carrying out experiments that are too dangerous for organics or assisting in the same. Occasionally, they can even be found leading biological, anthropological, or archaeological field research.
[P]RH-series droids stand just shy of two meters tall, with a basic humanoid chassis covered in thick, protective plasteel plates. Their hands are packed with various manipulators, tools, probes, lights, and other small devices that allow the droids to carry out numerous scientific and research functions. They have a flat, oval-shaped head dominated by a single curving sensor window that resembles a helmet visor. RH-series droids are relatively agile and surefooted for droids, and they require little maintenance to keep running.
[P]These droids have a reputation for reliability-both mechanical and personal-while working in the field. They are detail oriented, are often work-obsessed, and can be fussy or develop various compulsive behaviors if they go too long between memory wipes. Alliance R&amp;D makes use of many RH-series droids, as do many freelance scientists and scholars the Alliance employs to discover new planets and make contact with new species.</Description>

The RM-series is a powerful, highly competent espionage droid from the powerful security firm MerenData. Until recently, MerenData was known for its line of espionage droids based on Cybot Galactica's 5PO protocol droids. The release of the RM-series was MerenData's first attempt at a droid designed in-house, and so far that attempt has been a rousing success. Only recently introduced after years of research and development, RMS are small, squat, kite-shaped droids about a meter tall, with an armored, flat-topped head. Their burly arms are tipped with heavy weapons, and numerous dexterous manipulators for grasping and fine-motor work hang from their flat undercarriages. These droids move about via a baffled repulsorlift engine that makes little noise and produce almost no energy signature or emissions. Their personalities are laconic and no-nonsense, although those droids that go without their regular maintenance and memory wipes develop strange philosophical or artistic streaks.
[P]RM-series droids specialize in military intelligence, specifically post-battle analytics and the study of enemy tactics and strategy. They are commonly dispatched to war zones to gather battlefield data and to observe how clashing forces fight in various galactic conditions. As this is an exceedingly dangerous task, these droids are well armored and carry an array of heavy anti-personnel and anti-droid weaponry. They are equipped with a sophisticated suite of intelligence-gathering and data analysis systems and come packed with optical, audio, chemical, energy, and other sensors. RMS also possess respectable engineering and infiltration programming that allows them to act as combat engineers and saboteurs when needed. Many Imperial camps have been flattened by an RM-series droid's homemade explosives and cunning trickery.
[P]In Alliance and Imperial espionage circles, RM-series droids have gained a reputation as highly competent units that can be relied upon in the field. This is more so in the Alliance, where these droids are often part of infiltration and sabotage teams, in which their knowledge and offensive capabilities can be used to their fullest potential.</Description>

The Karflo Coporation, in support of its far-flung mining interests, created the SBD series to fill this necessary role.
[P]A rugged design, keen intellect, and desire to assist drive this droid to the greatest extremes in a crisis or disaster. The SBDs have proven to be able companions for those voyaging into dangerous environments, such as war zones and regions torn by natural disaster, where assisting locals in need may go a long way toward establishing good will and rapport. Anyone in the market for a droid of superior durability and utility who wants a chance to make a difference in a crisis would do well to consider the SBD series of assistance and rescue droids.

They can be ordered from the factory with a number of add-ons and special programs tailored to their owner's particular needs, from an illusionist's assistant to a wail band's percussionist. A Side Man has an obsequious, eager to please personality that professional entertainers tend to find incredibly irritating. As such, most SDMN droids working throughout the galaxy, especially those owned by musicians, have been reprogrammed to be both more enjoyable to be around and better suited to operating in the often seedy, disreputable trenches of the galactic entertainment industry. Despite their built-in personality flaws, Side Men are quite competent and are in high demand by professional and aspiring entertainers.</Description>

Their bodies are coated with an optical camouflage system that allows them to blend in with their surroundings, and they have an encrypted, long-range comms suite that allows them to transmit voice and data quickly and securely to allies.
[P]When in the field scouting or observing targets, SR-series droids are almost completely silent. Once back at base, however, they tend to chatter away endlessly at anyone unlucky enough to be in earshot This is especially pronounced following an extended deployment.</Description>

Particularly inconspicuous-looking, they stand just under two meters tall and appears to be normal third-degree droids, such as protocol models or teaching units. They have spindly limbs; an oversized, humanoid head with a featureless faceplate; and set of four small, red photoreceptors. These droids come in a cariety of gender programming options, and their personalities are usually queit and conciliatory. THey seem, at first glance, to be simple, uncomplicated droids going about their drudgery with little fanfare. Which, of course, is exactly what their designers want.
[P]Their innocuous looks and seemingly meek personalities are only one of the myriad of weapons the TC-SC droids utilize. They are deadly and cunning, easily equal to the best espionage agents in the ISB. Their programming includes not only intelligence and counterintelligence techniques, but also stealth, infiltration, combat, assassination, and even acting and mimicry. The most potent weapon, however, is the powerful CQ-3.80 multispectrum disguise suite that shroud them in a nearly foolproof holographic disguise. This allows TC-SC droids to take on the appearance of nearly any species in the galaxy. Combined with their programming, and given time to observe and study a target, these droids can even impersonate specific individuals.
[P]While they are quite effective and dangerous, TC-SC droids are, thankfully, relatively rare. Their systems—though powerful—are delicate, and the droids require constant maintenance. They also require memory wipes more often than other droids due to quirks in their programming. Without the regular maintenance and memory wipes, some TC-SC droids have lost themselves in their disguises and come to believe that they are acutally who or what they were last impersonating. On a few rare occasions, these droids have gone rogue and disappeared. At least two ISB TC-SC droids have deserted their missions in the Outer Rim in the last decade and remain at large in the galacy following their own whims.</Description>

[P]Briefly manufactured by Balmorran Arms, and loosley based upon their SD-series battle droid, these droids were designed to complement live sparring partners during the training of youn Imperial officer cadets. However, instructors found that the TRD-series lacked the killer instinct of more purpose-built combat droids, resulting in fewer training deaths and the perception that trainees were being coddled. The sparring droids were subsequently phased out of service. As the Empire moved on with more lethal units, the TRDs were reproduced, often for crowd suppression or as inexpensive corporate security. There are still examples of the TRD units being used for their original purpose, however, with organizations that feel the droid's versatility and resilience impart a deeper mastery of a wider array of combat skills.
[P]Buzzing back and forth on their whirring treads, the TRD's arms flash with lightning reflexes, showcasing the fighting styles of over a hundred thousand cultures programmed into the droid's core memory systems. Variable limb configurations serve to mimic the strengths and weaknesses of countless foes. Many find a TRD-2 droid one of the best tests of martial prowess to be found.</Description>

The construction and use of interrogation droids is looked down upon in the more civilized areas of the galaxy. That being said, the widespread ethical concerns surrounding these frightening droids has never stopped droid manufacturers from building them, nor has it stopped government agencies and criminal enterprises from purchasing as many as they can. For the main branches of Imperial Military Intelligence, Arakyd Industries has been the provider of choice for droids. The notorious and frightening IT-O series started out as an Arakyd design before being retooled by the Department of Military Research, and Arakyd's Viper probe droid is also a common Imperial Navy standby. Arakyd's new TS-series interrogation droids are the latest addition to the Empire's roster.
[P]Marketed as "medical droids," TS-series droids are small, inhuman-looking constructs just over two meters tall. They have a thin, flat, curving torso similar to a droideka's and two long, spindly arms equipped with a frightening array of blades, injectors, cutting lasers, and other vicious-looking medical apparatus. Their flat, cowled head sports four bright-red photoreceptors all in a horizontal line. The base of their body is a flattened triangle that acts as a counter-weight and the hub of a low-profile, solid rubber wheel used for locomotion. While they can talk, and are often effusive when reporting information or discussing interrogation techniques with their handlers or other droids, TS-series interrogators are relatively quiet when performing actual interrogations. They tend to ask simple, uncomplicated questions in a straightforward and often cheerful manner, apply pain as needed, and repeat the sequence until they get the information they require.
[P]Very few of these ghastly droids exist currently, and all of them are in service with the Imperial Military Intelligence services. Word of their introduction has recently begun circulating throughout the Alliance, primarily from Rebel moles within the ISB. The rumors of the TS-series' capabilities grow more and more outrageous with every telling, and there is currently a large reward for any Rebel cell that can capture one and return it intact for study.</Description>

Initially designated the “CDE-T,” Baktoid Combat
Automata’s T-series tactical droid first entered service
in the years leading up to the Clone Wars. Boxy and
awkward looking, with a humanoid configuration,
spindly limbs, and a strangely small, roughly hexagonal
head, the T-series droids were designed to act as
military advisers and aides-de-camp. With a powerful
and analytical brain and a vast database of galactic
military history, a T-series droid can quickly size up a
situation and almost immediately provide a handful of solutions and tactics relevant to the current conditions.
While these droids are extremely competent
military advisors, the first few generations of the
T-series gained a reputation for impatience, arrogance,
and patronizing, didactic lecturing that
aggravated their non-droid colleagues to no end. The
majority of the T-series droids were eventually
upgraded to super tactical droids, with more efficient
systems and personality patches that reined in some
of their worst traits. Very few T-series tactical droids
are in service today, and those that are serve among
the officer corps of the Alliance Military.</Description>

[P]Throughout the history of the galaxy, there have been many innovative approaches to education. While the inevitable march of progress has seen a veritable raft of educational and instructor droids flood the Core Worlds through the millennia, many cultures continue to advocate the ancient discipline of lecturing. One manufacturer sought to combine both approaches in a single laminanium shell. Industrial Automaton's popular TTS 15-series education and tutorial droid was modified with further dialectic and communcations modules to create the TTS20, one of the most successful orator droids in the galaxy.
[P]Programmed in over a million styles and disciplines of organized argument and debate, this droid is the best foil for any being training to be a solicitor, diplomat, or negotiator. Often the pressures of its contentious programing will cause individual units to develop a particularly quarrelsome personality if their buffers are not cleared regularly. Strangely enough, however, some owners of the TTS20 series see this as an added feature and will encourage their droids to develop even greater heights of insolent confrontation.</Description>

The WSW Mk III "Harrier" is a combat and training remote produced by Cybot Galactica . Roughly a meter across, these small droids are near-mindless drones that resemble small, stylized airspeeders. Shockingly aggressive and quite dangerous in groups, these constructs are deployed in en masse to overwhelm a target by sheer force of numbers. Even a single Harrier is a dangerous opponent, as it is quick and remarkably heavily armed, with a custom repeating blaster. Harriers can also be used as training remotes, as they possess built-in training software and a stun blaster that is used in place of the more lethal repeating blaster.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]DTS-series Dismantler Droid[h3]
Industrial Automaton's DTS-series dismantler droids are a common sight in the galaxy's ports and breaking yards. Dismantlers are big, surprisingly numble droids roughly the size of a small starfighter or large airspeeder. They are shaped somewhat like a mushroom, with a large sensor-studded dome of a head perched on a thin cylindrical body. Four insect-like legs surround the base of the body, and two massive arms tipped with powerful crushing claws sprout from beneath the head. Designed to dismantle and recycle starships, these burly droids are equipped with a suite of destructive tools and weapons, backed with the strength to use them. To get around shipyards quickly, dismantlers are also equipped with a repulsorlift generator and numerous small thrusters that give them a surprising turn of speed.
[P]While they are intelligent, they are remarkable single-minded and rarely interact with organic sentient beings other than to take orders, report, and ask for clarifications. This gives them a reputation as slow-witted and dull, which makes individuals unfamiliar with these droids tend to underestimate them.</Description>

Electrobinoculars come in many shapes and sizes, depending on their role and the species to use them. Neuro-Saav's Model TD2.3s, for example, are electrically powered and allow for high levels of magnification in zoom and panoramic views. They also offer vision in very high or very low levels of light, thermal imaging, and (in more expensive versions) recording and playback modes. Informational overlays also provide distances, elevations, and velocities of sighted targets.

[P]Electrobinoculars allow the user to see normally in low light or extremely bright conditions, and can magnify targets up to ten kilometers away. When using electrobinoculars, characters may also remove up to [SE] imposed due to long range or poor light.

The galaxy is filled with security devices to keep valuables protected or secured. A good thief knows that the stronger the security, the more valuable the items inside, and the greater the desire to make them his own. Many locks across the galaxy have complex electronic systems that far surpass the simple mechanical locks of old. Electronic lock breakers like those made by the fancifully named OutlawTech (a group of slicers and criminal technicians) are automatic anti-security slicing systems that can hack
through most standard electronic locks. There are also much more advanced models that require no skill on the user's part and can defeat the most complicated locks.

      [H3]Electric Perimeter Fence[h3]

Made by a number of manufacturers throughout the galaxy, portable electric perimeter fences use beams of coherent energy to make a protective barrier around encampments, outposts, or any other sensitive areas that require extra security. Composed of a powerful energy generator and a number of sturdy plasteel posts equipped with repeater/booster modules and long anchoring spikes, these fences are constructed by simply finding a safe place for the generator and placing the posts along the desired perimeter. Once the perimeter is set, the generator is hooked up to one of the posts to provide the energy. When the generator is activated, the power it produces is projected and amplified by each of the fence posts, creating a nearly impassable fence made of crackling, humming energy beams. Basic models must be completely deactivated to allow anything to pass through, but the more advanced models have controls that allow for the various sections between posts to be activated and deactivated at will. Anyone coming into contact with a portable electric perimeter fence suffers the effects of a stun grenade.</Description>

      [H3]Electro-Snare[h3]

There are countless devices in the galaxy designed to incapacitate a target or prey animal so that it can be captured alive. These include stun batons, gas grenades, and even low-powered blaster rifles used to short circuit a sentient's nervous system and render him unconscious. One of the smallest, simplest devices is the ubiquitous electro-snare. Little more than a power pack, an energy-discharge node, and a proximity sensor contained in a light metal frame, electro-snares are produced by many manufacturers in the galaxy. Simple and effective, electro-snares are difficult to detect, nearly foolproof, and one of the safest and most humane stun devices on the market.

[P]To use an electro-snare, an individual must make a [B]Survival check[b] to set and conceal the snare with a difficulty set by the Game Master based on surrounding environmental factors. Once successfully hidden, any animal or sentient approaching the snare must make an [B]Opposed Perception check[b] against the Survival skill of the character who originally set the snare. If the snare remains undetected, it fires a powerful stun blast at the target once it enters engaged range, automatically hitting and dealing 10 stun damage (the damage is applied to the target's strain threshold but does not ignore soak), plus 2 additional damage per [SU] scored on the initial Survival check.</Description>

Medpacs are common even on those ships that do not engage in activities of dubious legality, for even those with little medical training can use the contents to treat injuries and save lives. Most ships carry several, and they are a common component in most survival gear. Standard medpacs contain field dressings, bacta patches, basic drugs, antiseptics, medical tools and knives, blood coagulators, synthflesh applicators, and more, all designed for ease of use and fast patient stabilization. The GLiS (General Life-Sustaining) also has a limited diagnostic scanner to monitor a patient's vital signs, and a computer that can provide treatment options. The intention of this medpac is to allow for basic first aid in the field.

[P]Medpacs allow characters to attempt to heal others using Medicine checks without penalty, as detailed on page 219.

Designed to encode messages sent over comlink or via subspace, encryption modules attach to comlinks or hypertransceivers and allow for secure communications on the battlefield or across long distances. Significantly larger and far more sophisticated than a simple comm scrambler, encryption modules use extremely complex algorithms and ciphers to code transmissions. Without the decryption key needed to decode the transmission, it is nearly impossible to break the code. Used primarily by diplomats, military, and large corporations, encryption modules have also proved useful for bounty hunters, smugglers, and others on the fringe who wish to keep their communications private.

[P]Attempts to decode messages sent through an encryption module without a receiver with the decryption key are [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI])[b] and require the use of sophisticated equipment, such as a ship's mainframe or a Class One droid.

An EOD kit is perfect for such efforts, as it contains tools expressly designed for this dangerous line of work.

      [H3]Emergency Repair Patch[h3]

Emergency repair patches, like the SoroSuub Pocket Tech, are designed to be both portable and able to be used quickly in an emergency. An emergency repair patch consists of a semi-flexible durasteel disk rimmed with auto-activating thermal welds. Some also contain an electrically inert inner insulation layer to protect against shortouts. The patch can be quickly applied over a damaged portion of a droid's chassis, then almost instantly spot-welded into place, keeping the vulnerable interior safe from further damage and maintaining the chassis's structural integrity.

[P]Emergency repair patches are one-use items that mechanics can use to patch small holes in items or vehicles, or droids can use to heal wounds. The second use is more common. It takes a maneuver for a character to use an emergency repair patch on himself or another. An emergency repair patch automatically heals 3 wounds on a droid. A droid can use emergency repair patches five times in a day. The sixth emergency repair patch heals no wounds—the droid is so patched together that further patches would be useless. It takes a day for the droid's self repair diagnostics (or some actual repairs) to restore his body to enough functionality to be able to accept additional emergency patches. See page 220 for more information.

Many free droids find the notion of being placed back into servitude intolerable. While some worlds have laws preventing a free droid from being subjected to a restraining bolt, many more do not, and criminals rarely let the law get in their way regardless. Most droids concerned about this fate simply resolve to never be caught in a situation where a restraining bolt could be applied, but some turn to trusted Droid Techs to get an escape circuit installed. These internal systems function similarly to cybernetics in organics, augmenting the droid’s verbobrain with the capacity to resist and even overload restraining bolts through concentrated effort.

[P]An escape circuit is a cybernetic implant that can only be installed in droids. A droid installed with an escape circuit can resist a restraining bolt with an [B]Easy ([DI]) Discipline check[b] instead of the normal difficulty (see page 178 of the [B]Edge of The Empire[b] Core Rulebook). The droid may spend [AD][AD] from a check made to resist a restraining bolt to overload the bolt, rendering it entirely useless.

Galactic civilization is incredibly ancient. Sentient beings have been plying the spacelanes and settling planets for millennia. Cities, empires, and even entire civilizations have risen, flourished, and fallen numerous times in countless places in the galaxy. Occasionally, these ancient peoples left behind great works of engineering—ancient cities, vast orbiting shipyards, lonesome abandoned space stations, huge necropolises, and the like—but mostly they drove themselves into oblivion, and the only remains are shattered remnants and half-remembered stories. Throughout the galaxy, intrepid sentients of all species who possess a wandering spirit and a thirst for knowledge sift through the remains of the ancient past to both help understand where the species of the galaxy have been and where the future is taking them. To help these adventurous scholars with their labors, numerous precision-tool makers in the galaxy produce tool kits of varying size and quality that make an attempt to be both compact and all-inclusive. By far the most popular of these tool kits is the Excavator Precision Tool Kit from Loronar Corporation.

[P]Designed for and marketed to scholars, historians, and archaeologists, the PTK contains a number of well-crafted hand tools and essential accessories for excavation of ancient sites and general exploration. Included are a number of hand spades and brushes of various size, a multitool, a stout knife, a pair of spring-loaded shears for cutting roots and vines, metal and ferroceramic files for sharpening tools, writing utensils, sample bags of various sizes, adhesive and string tags for categorizing finds, measuring equipment, a small spool of monofilament, and small picks, hammers, and mallets of different weights and material.

Slavers and slaveholders do not always keep slaves locked up in chains while they carry out their duties. Many slavers inject tiny tracking and explosive devices to discourage slaves from running. A corresponding handheld device similar to a droid caller can locate the implanted target with a [B]Simple (-) Computers check[b]. With the press of a button, the implant can explode, instantly killing its victim. [P] A [B]Daunting ([CH][DI][DI][DI]) Medicine[b] or [B]Mechanics check[b] is required to remove the implant. However, [TH] alerts the transmitter of the tampering, and [DE] triggers the device.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]Explosives Belt[h3]
A tool of Saboteurs and Infiltrators, the explosives belt is a small and convenient concealed demolitions kit. Produced in a wide variety of styles by various intelligence agencies throughout the galaxy, a typical explosives belt is a broad hide or synthetic belt with a sturdy buckle. Hidden within the belt strap is a length of detonite tape; a remote detonator cap and a length of wire are concealed in the buckle. Once placed, the detonator can be triggered by a comlink or a dedicated remote device. Explosives belts are typically used for sabotage, but they can also blast a door or hatch open for a quick escape in a pinch.
[P]Setting the explosive charge hidden in the belt requires an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]. The charge detonates with the following profile: (Damage 15; Critical 3; Range (Engaged); Blast 5, Breach 1, Limited Ammo 1). Upgrade the difficulty of checks to detect the belt's true nature twice.</Description>

A particularly intimidating and malicious method of securing slaves and prisoners, explosive shackles have small but lethal charges built into them to deter escape attempts.

[P]Removing explosive shackles without the proper key requires a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Skulduggery check[b]. If a character fails this check, the shackles detonate, inflicting 10 wounds on the wearer and each character in engaged range (this ignores soak).

[P]Miners and prospectors depend upon a reliable geoscanner to identify the location of ore deposits. A range of different sensors probe beneath a planet's surface to a depth of nearly two kilometers. These handheld devices can detect the different elements and minerals present in the strata as well as ascertaining their relative frequences. These systems can be tuned to recognize precious minerals and ores, even estimating the quantity and trade value of deposits. Geoscanners warn users of any seismic, volcanic, or thermal activity, so that appropriate precautions may be taken. They also recognize hollow areas and subsurface water deposits, which can be crucial in choosing a location to mine.
[P]A geoscanner adds [BO] to any Perception, Lore, or Education checks related to studying the subterranean environment within medium range of the user.</Description>

      [H3]False Credentials[h3]

In the vast police state of the Galactic Empire, a lack of proper identification can draw unwanted attention from Imperial authorities. However, for those who would rather keep their actual names to themselves, false identities and the accompanying credentials can be obtained for a price. Clever forgers and slicers create false credentials, counterfeit licenses, and fake permits embedded on standard electronic identification cards that can fool even the most sophisticated holoscanners.

[P]False credentials can fool most cursory examinations, and characters using scanners require a successful [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Computers check[b] to recognize the credentials as fakes (or a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b] without equipment).

      [H3]Viscera Field Dressing Kit[h3]

When hunting for sustenance or for pure sport, most hunters kill their prey in the field as opposed to trapping it and taking a live—and possibly quite angry—animal back to camp. Quite often these creatures weigh hundreds of kilograms, and even the most well-equipped hunting party balks at dragging a large, dead prey animal overland for many kilometers. To this end, most prey is butchered in the field, its innards removed and the usable meat cut from the carcass and stored in cooling chests for easy transportation. Referred to as field dressing, the act of cleaning and gutting an animal is a bloody and time-consuming task that, like most other complex tasks, can be made quicker and easier through the use of proper tools. For the discerning hunter, SurvivalEquipment Inc. sells the popular and easily carried Viscera Field Dressing Kit.

[P]The Viscera Field Dressing Kit contains a selection of saws and knives of various shapes and sizes, gut hooks, spring-loaded shears, a portable vacuum packer, sturdy gloves, and a ten-meter coil of extremely strong and incredibly thin synthetic rope. The blades of the tools are all made of a resilient, precision-laser-ground, durasteel-reinforced crystal-ceramic that keeps its edge far longer than other types of knives. These tools come in a compact, locking, impact-resistant polymer case with custom-cut form-fitted recesses for each knife, hook, and saw. The case also contains a small, low-storage datapad with anatomical charts for most known sport and food animals, as well as charts showing different cuts of meat, butchery instructions, sanitation instructions, and other helpful tips for dressing a kill.

[P]Using the Viscera Field Dressing Kit grants a hunter [BO] to any Survival skill checks made to harvest meat, organs, or bones from a prey animal.</Description>

An ingenious way to stay fed in the wilderness, the Field Kitchen is the latest offering from SurvivalEquipment Inc. Designed for large, semipermanent encampments, like hunting camps or forward-scout bases, the field kitchen includes all the tools needed to feed a small number of sentients for extended periods of time. Packed in a broad, flat, impact-resistant case, the field kitchen includes a small, high-output induction-cooking range and oven combination, a selection of stacking pots and pans, a set of good-quality knives, cooking utensils, a water-purification system, a food sterilizer, and a flash-freezing and vacuum-sealing system for storing food. Also included is a datapad containing a nutritional database outlining the daily nutritional needs for most of the galaxy's known sentient species, an exhaustive guide to identifying, foraging, and eating wild plants, basic cooking instructions, and a database of recipes optimized for cooking in the wilderness.

[P]Setting up a field kitchen takes about thirty standard minutes. Thanks to the efficient design and the information included in the datapad, using a field kitchen grants [BO][BO] to any Survival or Education skill checks made to store, identify, cook, or sterilize comestibles (and can, at the GM's discretion, allow the processing of foods that normally could not be made edible). </Description>

      [H3]Fingerprint Masque[h3]

For those who are serious about keeping their identity unknown, fingerprint masques are essential. A thin, liquid-crystal biometric screen applied to the fingertip, a fingerprint masque creates a random fingerprint pattern or mimics known patterns. Advanced masques can also be embedded with false DNA in order to circumvent more sophisticated biometric scanners and readers.
[P]Fingerprint masques can fool basic fingerprint readers with nothing more than an [B]Easy ([DI]) Cool[b] or [B]Deception check[b], while more advanced scanners require an [B]Average ([DI][DI])[b] or [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) check[b], at the GM's discretion. If the biometric scanner operator has reason to be suspicious of a character wearing a fingerprint masque, it may require an opposed social skill check versus the operator's Computers skill. A character must make a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b] to actually notice the physical presence of a fingerprint masque on an individual's fingers.

Foamcast is the commonly used term for a type of quicksetting aerosol foam found in construction and building maintenance. It comes in a tall can with a trigger-activated applicator, and a long, narrow tube provided with each can allows for precision application. When sprayed into a crack, dent, hole, or other space,  foamcast expands and then quickly hardens. Once dry, a foamcast patch is nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings and has all the strength and wearability of plascrete. Foamcast can also be poured into molds to make light obstacles and temporary shelters.
[P]Foamcast adds [BO] to checks to repair structures and vehicle hulls. The GM may spend [TH] on such checks to indicate the foamcast dispenser can is depleted. A can of foamcast can be made into an improvised explosive with a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]. When used in this way, a can of foamcast has the following profile: Mechanics; Damage 4; Critical 5; Range (Short); Blast 4, Ensnare 4, Inferior, Prepare 2.

This dubiously named field stove is more commonly known to military personnel as a "hot plate," and is little more than a collapsible tray with integrated thermal circuitry for preparing field rations and other food products. The thermal circuits are powered by solar energy, but the durable surface of the hot plate can be used to cook with fire paste or even over a wood fire.</Description>

      [H3]Foot Speeder[h3]
These curious contraptions combine the swiftness of a speeder car with an ease of storage and simple construction that makes keeping and maintaining them much less expensive than doing so for an actual vehicle. Foot speeders are contructed around a repulsorlift pad large enough for a single being to stand upon, with a steering vane extending up that doubles as a support for the occupant to hold arms.
[P]A foot speeder allows a person to function as a Silhoette 1, Speed 1, Handling -1, System Strain Threshold 4 vehicle that can only operate in atmosphere, and requires Piloting (Planetary) to operate. It has a flight ceiling of five meters.
[P][I]Note: This item is also included as a vehicle.[i]

      [H3]Forensics Investigation Kit[h3]

Essentially a specialized tool kit for crime scene investigations, forensic investigation kits are produced by a number of security companies for use by law enforcement agencies. Whatever their origin, these kits typically contain a number of medical instruments, evidence collection containers, chemical swabs, magnifiers, scanners, multi-spectrum light emitters, marking tools, and different kinds of solvents, adhesives, and specialty chemicals.

[P]When used during the investigation of a crime, a forensic investigation kit adds automatic [SU] to all Perception checks made by the user to spot and gather evidence. It may also count as the right tools for the job when making checks to analyze the evidence gathered (see page 171 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rulebook). At the GM's discretion, this item can also be used for related purposes such as archeological digs.</Description>

      [H3]Frangawl Force Powder[h3]
Frangawl cultists are masters of dark side techniques, including ones that deal with capturing and corrupting the Living Force in a sentient being. The cult practices rituals that culminate in acts of brutal sacrifice. As their victims die, Force sensitives among the cultists use tools to extract the Living Force from them. Once extracted, the energy can be used to power a ritual in progress, or it can be preserved for some future purpose.
[P]One way the cultists preserve the energy is to store it in a very fine crystalline powder. When charged with the Living Force, the powder glows with a faint blue hue. A single sacrifice typically yields several doses of Frangawl Force powder.
[P]A Force-sensitive character can consume a dose of Frangawl Force powder as a maneuver. Upon doing so, the PC gains 10 Conflict and adds automatic [DA][DA] to the PCs next Force power check during that encounter.

      [H3]Broadhead Arrow (Field Sports FS19 Compound Bow)[h3]
Traditional, projectile-throwin bow weapons are a rarity in the galaxy. They are considered even more archaic and efficient than slugthrowers, and are rarely seen outside of museums or the collections of passionate enthusiasts. Even the vaunted bowcaster used by Wookiees is an energy weapon, despite its antiquated appearance. There are times, however, when the simplicity, portability, and reliablity of a bow—not to mention its near silence of operation and broad selection of ammunition types are exactly what a given situation requires.
[P]The FS19 by Field Sports is one of the better bows sold throughout the galaxy. Roughly hald as long as a grown human is tall, the FS19 uses a system of pulleys and cams to increase an archer's leverage and strength, therefore producing a more powerful and efficent weapon in a small easy-to-use package. The bow itesle if built from plasteel-reinforced polycarbonates, which give it incredible strength, and the string is a polyfiber nylamesh weave designed to minimize stretch and sag.
[P]The basic ammunition used with the FS19 is Field Sports' Mk IV "Broadhead" arrow, which consists of a meter-long plasteel shaft with with  sharp, bladed point at one end and synthetic, spin stabilizing fletching on the other. THese arrows are cheap to replace; the GM who wishes to set a price could charge 1 credit per arrow. In addition, Field Sports produces a line of other arrows for use with the FS19 that increase the weapon's versatility [B]Table 2—1: Ranged Weapons[b], on page 47, gives the base profile for the standard arrows that come with the weapon as with the profiles for the non-standard arrows for the bow.</Description>

      [H3]False Voice Transmitter[h3]
[P]The Rebel Alliance has been known to utilize homemade devices known colloquially as false voice transmitters, or FVTs, to fool the Empire for years. The original FVTs were jury-rigged by taking the verbobrain from a protocol droid, a voice-synth box (possibly from the same droid), and a datapad, and combining them with a number of readily available components. The speaker either types in the words to be conveyed with the FVT, or uses a microphone to say them out loud. Due to the usefulness of such devices, the Rebel Alliance began manufacturing them in small numbers.
[P]As long as an appropriate voice sample is available, an FVT can replicate nearly any organic voice. When used to transmit messages via comlink, the replicated voice is nearly indistinguishable from the original. Despite the benefit an FVT provides, it is only as good as the voice sample used and the turns of phrase the user adopts during the vocal charade.
[P]When impersonating another individual with the aid of an FVT, the user can upgrade the ability of his Charm, Coercion, Deception, Leadership, and Negotiation checks once.</Description>

    <Description>
      [H3]Glitterstim[h3]

Glitterstim is a vanishingly rare variety of spice, refined from the webs spun by the energy spiders of Kessel and mined by the unfortunate slaves sent into those pitch-black depths. Because of its photoactive qualities, it cannot be exposed to light at any stage before consumption, and so laborers at various stages carefully move it from the darkness of the caverns to special holding containers, and then to the small, opaque packets in which it is sold.

      [H3]Glitterstim[h3]

Glitterstim is a vanishingly rare variety of spice, refined from the webs spun by the energy spiders of Kessel and mined by the unfortunate slaves sent into those pitch-black depths. Because of its photoactive qualities, it cannot be exposed to light at any stage before consumption, and so laborers at various stages carefully move it from the darkness of the caverns to special holding containers, and then to the small, opaque packets in which it is sold. Its production is jealously guarded by the Empire, and thus a hold full of glitterstim is a treasure for any smuggler ambitious enough to try to sell it.

Most scanners are small, hand-held gear, designed to be simple and durable for field use by scouts and explorers. Depending on the model, they indicate the nearby presence of life forms, heat fonts, radiation sources, acoustic emissions, or any combination thereof. Some operate in all directions, displaying their results on screens or holo-displays, while others are directional and only give indications towards where they are pointing. The Cryoncorp EnhanceScan is a typical example of this. Small enough to be carried by a single scout, the scanner has life-form tracking, motion sensing, metal detection, and the ability to intercept standard frequency comlink transmissions. The motion sensing operates up to half a kilometer, while the remaining systems can detect targets up to a kilometer and a half, and the comlink interceptor can catch signals from much further.

These hovering, slablike devices are the latest attempts to thwart any would-be ship thieves. They are a recent Imperial invention, and can be found on most major planetary docking bays and shipyards as a response to growing resistance missions to acquire Imperial vessels. Once firmly clamped onto each leg of a ship’s landing gear, gravity locks use tractor beam technology to ensure a ship cannot take off. Their tough construction also means they are almost impossible to forcibly remove or even destroy without using weapons that will likely damage the ship itself.
[P]A single gravity lock costs 7,400 credits (rarity 6). It has a silhouette of 3 and encumbrance of 14, and counts as having a soak value of 15 and a wound threshold of 10. If attacked, [TH][TH] or [DE] may be spent to inflict half of the damage it suffers onto a ship to which it has been attached. Entering the unique key code created when the lock is installed is the usual manner to deactivate the device, but it can be dismantled in a laborious process requiring an upgraded [B]Formidable ([CH][CH][DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b] and eight hours of hard work. If the character has direct knowledge of a gravity lock’s inner workings, they check is not upgraded and the process takes half the time.

Another sensor suite produced by CryonCorp, the GPSP is a powerful ground-penetrating radar suite marketed to companies involved in gas and minerals exploration and chartered search and rescue. Little more than a bulky stack of fine-tuned sensors mounted in an impact and weather-resistant plasteel case, the GPSP uses a powerful ground-penetrating radar array to look through solid objects to see what lies beneath. Either carried slung over an operator's shoulder by a stout strap or mounted to a small repulsor cart, the GPSP can see through soil, dense stone of various types, most kinds of ores and processed metals, organic and inorganic debris, duracrete, ferrocrete, and nearly any other kind of substance that might be encountered. Recently, CryonCorp has released an updated version of the GPSP geared more toward scholarly exploration, with a radar array specially tuned for penetration of
inorganic, artificially produced building materials like the kind found in the ruins of ancient cities. Using a GPSP does not require a skill check, but interpreting the unit's findings might. If the Game Master sees fit, he can require a Computers skill check to figure out what exactly the GPSP is seeing.</Description>

GV/3 guardian droids come standard with strong loyalty imprint software that can be keyed to any number of subjects. As long as a specific individual is imprinted in the droid's memory, it follows that being's commands and, to the best of its ability, prevents that person from being injured, whether by deliberate action or by accident. Despite the GV/3's physical strength, it is capable of being gentle and even playful, especially around children.
[P]The GV/3 is popularly used for home security and by law enforcement agencies. It has also been adapted to search and rescue operations with much success. Though it is considered a benign droid in most areas, some models have been modified by unscrupulous individuals for criminal applications.</Description>

    <Name>Holographic Image Disguiser</Name>
    <Description>[H3]Holographic Image Disguiser[h3]
Also known as holoshrouds, holographic image disguisers (HIDs) use a small, self-contained holoprojector to create a holographic disguise for a single person or object. They project a high-resolution, prerendered image that completely covers a target. The holographic images are incredibly lifelike: they move, breathe, blink, twitch, etc. They are good enough to nearly always fool the unaided eye without a thorough inspection.
[P]HIDs are not perfect, however, and they are often not as useful as a regular or cybernetic disguise kit. Having an extremely low memory capacity, they can only store one prerendered image, which must be loaded in advance and cannot be changed on the fly. In addition, while an HID can fool a casual observer with ease, many droids, cameras, and other scanners can see through the disguise, thanks to the very faint flicker inherent in even the best hologram. They also consume an enormous amount of energy. Due to their small on-board energy cells, HIDs can only operate for a few minutes at a time unless they are plugged into an external power supply. They also do not emulate vocal patterns, like the uniquely personalized holographic disguise matrix that the Snivvian bounty hunter/technician Sinrich designed during the Clone Wars. This means users must apply their own skills in verbal deception to complete a disguise.
[P]A holographic disguise needs to be the same size as the target or larger. Detecting an HID with the naked eye requires a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b]. Droids and anyone viewing the target through a scanner, electrobinoculars, or other technological optical device require only an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Perception check[b].</Description>

Along with the usual light-amplification and thermal-imaging sensors found in most scanner goggles, hunting goggles are equipped with an image magnification and enhancement system, a short-range motion detector, and a targeting system and micro heads-up display that projects aiming reticules and targeting information into the wearer's field of vision. Hunting goggles sharpen the wearer's vision to a preternatural degree, and they allow him to see clearly in the dark and through fog, smoke, haze, and other obscuring agents. All of these systems combine to make a highly useful piece of equipment for those who make their livings stalking beasts and sentients through the Outer Rim.

Often, a hunter needs to track prey across tremendous distances. Sometimes this could be to identify a base of operations, other times it might simply be a matter of tailing a lead to a mark when the actual target's location is unknown. A homing beacon is a device that tracks a starship or its passengers and cargo even after a hyperspace jump. Homing beacons depend upon using existing HoloNet transceivers to transmit their location back to their source. Consequently, their effectiveness is sharply limited when the vehicle travels to a system that is not connected to the HoloNet.
[P]Homing beacons vary substantially in size and in their means of application. Smaller models can be thrown by hand or manually attached to their targets. Larger ones may be fired from a rifle or even a vehilce-mounted weapon to track a more distant target. The size of the homing beacon is most relevent in determining the likelihood that anyone on the target vessel might notice its presence.
[P]As long as a homing beacon is functional, the person who activated it may trace the associated target across the galaxy. No tests are required, so long as the targets travels within known systems. A homing beacon remains functional indefinitely, unless it is deactivated.</Description>

      [H3]Holocron of Astrogation and Gunnery[h3]

A holocron, or holographic chronicle, is an organomechanical data storage device capable of storing tremendous amounts of data in a small package. These fist-sized constructs were first created long ago by the Jedi and the Sith to record and store the knowledge and hard-won experience of members of their respective orders. Made from unique crystals encased in layers of precious metals and polycarbonites, these devices use advanced hologrammatic technology to map and store the contents of a single individual's neural pathways. In essence, holocrons record the memories and knowledge of a particular Jedi or Dark Lord of the Sith and store it for future reference.

[P]Holocrons are accessed through an advanced holographic operating system based on the personality of the individual upon whom the holocron is imprinted. These gatekeepers act as a user interface, search-and-recovery program, and security system. Once activated, a small hologram of the holocron's namesake is projected above the device. The gatekeeper is then addressed, and can teach lessons, answer questions, or simply engage in conversation with the user. Remarkably intelligent and observant, holocron gatekeepers use latent Force energies to read the motives and personality of the user, in order to tailor the user's experience to his level of skill, experience, and trustworthiness. Some gatekeepers, especially those created by the Sith or who have become corrupt over the centuries, can even lie to and lead astray an unsuspecting user, often doing irreparable damage.

[P]Most known holocrons were kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and the majority of those were lost during the Great Purge when Darth Sidious raided the Holocron Archives and either confiscated or destroyed everything he found there. Some few survived and are still at large throughout the galaxy, but with the proscription on the ownership of Jedi artifacts and rarity of holocrons, it's a rare person who has even heard of a holocron, let alone knows where to locate one.

[P]In [B]Force and Destiny[b], holocrons are more the goal of a quest or entire campaign rather than an item to be purchased or checked out of the local archives. Extremely rare and powerful, holocrons in a [B]Force and Destiny [b] game can have far-reaching consequences. Game Masters should be extremely cautious when introducing a holocron into a game. The following guidelines are presented to assist Game Masters in Introducing one of these powerful and desirable artifacts without ruining the tenor of the game.

[P]Depending on its nature, a holocron can grant new Force powers, increase the damage of a specific kind of attack (Melee, Ranged, Gunnery, Lightsaber, etc.), grant basic or advanced talents, grant or increase a skill, or anything else a Game Master can imagine. On his first attempt to use a holocron, a character must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Knowledge (Lore) check[b] to activate the device and summon the gatekeeper. Once the holocron is activated, the character who activated it must spend an amount of time dictated by the Came Master studying the holocron and conversing with the gatekeeper before benefiting from whatever bonuses the holocron provides.

      [H3]Holocron of Brawl and Streetwise[h3]

A holocron, or holographic chronicle, is an organomechanical data storage device capable of storing tremendous amounts of data in a small package. These fist-sized constructs were first created long ago by the Jedi and the Sith to record and store the knowledge and hard-won experience of members of their respective orders. Made from unique crystals encased in layers of precious metals and polycarbonites, these devices use advanced hologrammatic technology to map and store the contents of a single individual's neural pathways. In essence, holocrons record the memories and knowledge of a particular Jedi or Dark Lord of the Sith and store it for future reference.

[P]Holocrons are accessed through an advanced holographic operating system based on the personality of the individual upon whom the holocron is imprinted. These gatekeepers act as a user interface, search-and-recovery program, and security system. Once activated, a small hologram of the holocron's namesake is projected above the device. The gatekeeper is then addressed, and can teach lessons, answer questions, or simply engage in conversation with the user. Remarkably intelligent and observant, holocron gatekeepers use latent Force energies to read the motives and personality of the user, in order to tailor the user's experience to his level of skill, experience, and trustworthiness. Some gatekeepers, especially those created by the Sith or who have become corrupt over the centuries, can even lie to and lead astray an unsuspecting user, often doing irreparable damage.

[P]Most known holocrons were kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and the majority of those were lost during the Great Purge when Darth Sidious raided the Holocron Archives and either confiscated or destroyed everything he found there. Some few survived and are still at large throughout the galaxy, but with the proscription on the ownership of Jedi artifacts and rarity of holocrons, it's a rare person who has even heard of a holocron, let alone knows where to locate one.

[P]In [B]Force and Destiny[b], holocrons are more the goal of a quest or entire campaign rather than an item to be purchased or checked out of the local archives. Extremely rare and powerful, holocrons in a [B]Force and Destiny [b] game can have far-reaching consequences. Game Masters should be extremely cautious when introducing a holocron into a game. The following guidelines are presented to assist Game Masters in Introducing one of these powerful and desirable artifacts without ruining the tenor of the game.

[P]Depending on its nature, a holocron can grant new Force powers, increase the damage of a specific kind of attack (Melee, Ranged, Gunnery, Lightsaber, etc.), grant basic or advanced talents, grant or increase a skill, or anything else a Game Master can imagine. On his first attempt to use a holocron, a character must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Knowledge (Lore) check[b] to activate the device and summon the gatekeeper. Once the holocron is activated, the character who activated it must spend an amount of time dictated by the Came Master studying the holocron and conversing with the gatekeeper before benefiting from whatever bonuses the holocron provides. The character does not have to make the check to activate the Holocron on subsequent uses.

[P]In [B]Force and Destiny[b], holocrons are more the goal of a quest or entire campaign rather than an item to be purchased or checked out of the local archives. Extremely rare and powerful, holocrons in a [B]Force and Destiny [b] game can have far-reaching consequences. Game Masters should be extremely cautious when introducing a holocron into a game. The following guidelines are presented to assist Game Masters in Introducing one of these powerful and desirable artifacts without ruining the tenor of the game.

[P]Depending on its nature, a holocron can grant new Force powers, increase the damage of a specific kind of attack (Melee, Ranged, Gunnery, Lightsaber, etc.), grant basic or advanced talents, grant or increase a skill, or anything else a Game Master can imagine. On his first attempt to use a holocron, a character must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Knowledge (Lore) check[b] to activate the device and summon the gatekeeper. Once the holocron is activated, the character who activated it must spend an amount of time dictated by the Came Master studying the holocron and conversing with the gatekeeper before benefiting from whatever bonuses the holocron provides. The character does not have to make the check to activate the Holocron on subsequent uses.

[P]All holocrons, unless noted otherwise, grant an ongoing benefit to the user.

Further, some holocrons grant additional bonuses. Some bonuses are ongoing, but others take effect only once. In the latter case, the user may continue to consult the gatekeeper and even to search through the holocron for information, but the bonuses granted are not granted a second time.</Description>

Of course, while very lifelike, the holocron's personality is not truly sentient, though it may be hard to tell this at times.
[P]The holocon of the [I]Sanctuary[i] is intended to be a tool the PCs can use to learn about the ancient Jedi Order. It is not an unlimited fount of information, of course, and its knowledge is several thousand years old (so it knows nothing of current events). However it contains a great deal of basic Jedi instruction, which allows the GM and players to explain how the PCs are able to learn Jedi Force practices and train with lightsabers, for example.
[P]Each PC may count Discipline and Medicine as career skills as long as the group possesses the holocron.
[P]When making a Knowledge (Lore) check to learn about the Jedi, the PC's may use the holocron to make an assisted check. The holocron counts as having three ranks in Knowledge (Lore).</Description>

      [H3]Holocron of Skulduggery and Vigilance[h3]

A holocron, or holographic chronicle, is an organomechanical data storage device capable of storing tremendous amounts of data in a small package. These fist-sized constructs were first created long ago by the Jedi and the Sith to record and store the knowledge and hard-won experience of members of their respective orders. Made from unique crystals encased in layers of precious metals and polycarbonites, these devices use advanced hologrammatic technology to map and store the contents of a single individual's neural pathways. In essence, holocrons record the memories and knowledge of a particular Jedi or Dark Lord of the Sith and store it for future reference.

[P]Holocrons are accessed through an advanced holographic operating system based on the personality of the individual upon whom the holocron is imprinted. These gatekeepers act as a user interface, search-and-recovery program, and security system. Once activated, a small hologram of the holocron's namesake is projected above the device. The gatekeeper is then addressed, and can teach lessons, answer questions, or simply engage in conversation with the user. Remarkably intelligent and observant, holocron gatekeepers use latent Force energies to read the motives and personality of the user, in order to tailor the user's experience to his level of skill, experience, and trustworthiness. Some gatekeepers, especially those created by the Sith or who have become corrupt over the centuries, can even lie to and lead astray an unsuspecting user, often doing irreparable damage.

[P]Most known holocrons were kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and the majority of those were lost during the Great Purge when Darth Sidious raided the Holocron Archives and either confiscated or destroyed everything he found there. Some few survived and are still at large throughout the galaxy, but with the proscription on the ownership of Jedi artifacts and rarity of holocrons, it's a rare person who has even heard of a holocron, let alone knows where to locate one.

[P]In [B]Force and Destiny[b], holocrons are more the goal of a quest or entire campaign rather than an item to be purchased or checked out of the local archives. Extremely rare and powerful, holocrons in a [B]Force and Destiny [b] game can have far-reaching consequences. Game Masters should be extremely cautious when introducing a holocron into a game.

[P]Suljo Warde created the holocron to store his knowledge, including the secrets of the Force power he developed, Warde's Foresight. Although holocrons have numerous fail-safes to ensure that only qualified Jedi access their deepest secrets, not the least of which is the gatekeeper itself, Warde feared what his power of foresight could do in the wrong hands. This is the primary reason why he separated some of the holocron’s information into three kyber crystals. The PCs can only learn simple applications of Warde’s Foresight until they attain the first kyber crystal, as outlined on pages 10-11. [P]Additionally, as long as they have Warde’s holocron in their possession, the Player Characters treat [B]Brawl[b] and [B]Vigilance[b] as career skills. </Description>

The device—typically small enough to wear on a belt—includes a camera that can be used to record another individual's appearance to overlay on the wearer. A base model unit is capable of storing only a single disguise in memory at a time, though more sophisticated and expensive units do exist.
[P]The projected hologram must be at least marginally larger than the wearer in order to provide adequate concealment. Thus, it cannot be used to disguise a particularly large individual as a smaller one. The holograms are built around visible light. so do not grant concealment against infrared sensors or detection devices built around other energies.
[P]When using a holographic disguise matrix, the character can effectively impersonate the visual appearance of whomever the device has previously recorded.

Hologoggles enable wearers to experience an artificial environment, within which they can enjoy a realistic experience devoted to training a specific skill. Each set of hologoggles is specialized for training in a particular field of study at a predetermined level of aptitude. A course of training normally takes eight weeks to complete, at a rate of a few hours each day. When the user completes a course of study, a new set of hologoggles can be purchased to continue in that field at a more advanced level or to study in a different field.
[P]When purchasing a set of hologoggles, a character selects one non-combat skill. That skill now counts as a career skill as long as the character owns the goggles (however, at the GM's discretion, the goggles must be used for several hours a day for a period of several months to gain this bonus). A character may only receive benefits from one pair of hologoggles at a time; if he wishes to count a new skill as a career skill, he must discard the current set of hologoggles and purchase a new one.</Description>

      [H3]Holo-Megacaster[h3]
One of the standard tools for a public speaker, a holo-megacaster is a variation on a standard holocomm system. Instead of patching into the HoloNet for long-distance communication, the megacaster projects its user’s voice and image nearby, but magnified to a great volume and size. A typical model is capable of projecting images ranging from centimeters up to ten meters in height. The volume controls are similarly adjustable, suitable for addresses to small, private audiences or vast populist rallies.
[P]A character using a holo-megacaster adds [BO] to Presence-based checks to address a crowd, and allows the character’s image and voice to be clearly seen and heard at up to extreme range, depending on the settings used.

The HoloNet is one of the crowning achievements of galactic civilization; a nearly instantaneous galaxy-wide communications network. By routing information through millions of hyperwave transceivers and routers, the Empire enjoys a peerless means of communication.

[P]HoloNet relays, however, are ruinously expensive, and many planets on the Rim must do without. In addition, the Empire regulates the HoloNet and has reserved much of it for military use. However, for those who can afford it, a portable HoloNet relay is one of the few ways a colony can obtain instantaneous communication with the rest of the galaxy.

[P]The X-500 Portable HoloNet Relay allows the user to communicate with the HoloNet (although at the GM's discretion, the signal may be interrupted by jamming, environmental factors, or Imperial interference).</Description>

      [H3]Holoscanner (10 Encumbrance)[h3]

Used in spaceports and high-security locations throughout the galaxy, holoscanners can detect the presence of dangerous or illegal items without the need to physically search individuals or cargo containers. Using a combination of sensors, energy receptors, and holo-imaging, these large scanners detect and identify virtually any form of weaponry or illicit contraband. While some rare materials, such as cortosis or nightshadow, can foil holoscanners, vigilant operators watch for such obfuscation. Holoscanners come in various shapes and sizes, from small screens for inspecting individuals to massive machines designed to examine speeder trucks, cargo containers, and even light freighters.

[P]Holoscanners reduce the difficulty of Perception or Vigilance checks to discover concealed items on a person or in a container or vehicle by two. A holoscanner cannot typically scan an item or group of items with encumbrance higher than its own.

"Hand scanner" is a catchall designation for a wide variety of handheld scanning devices designed to run specific-purpose scans. Some of the most common versions of these are medisensors, such as the RFX/K Medisensor made by BioTech Industries. The device can be used independently or plugged into a medpac or datapad, and displays a variety of useful bio-signs about the subject. Other scanners can check for atmospheric contaminants, poisons, vermin, or in the case of mechanics, micro-fractures or stress points.

      [H3]Pioneer Long-Range Hypertransceiver[h3]

Also known as subspace transceivers, hypertransceivers are used for nearly instantaneous, faster-than-light communications between star systems. While not as advanced and efficient as those linked in to the HoloNet, hypertransceivers can send messages several light years, with powerful models such as this one able to transmit up to 100 light years. Most planets in the galaxy are integrated into a local subspace network independent of the galaxy-spanning HoloNet, with hyperspace transceivers on deep-space relay satellites to create sector-wide communications grid.

[P]Most starships have hypertransceivers to send long-range messages and transmit distress signals. Small, portable hypertransceivers are also available, with ranges up to about 25 light years. Utilizing local subspace systems, these transceivers can potentially send a message anywhere in the galaxy, routing the transmission across networks. Many smugglers and assorted criminals prefer to send messages using private hypertransceivers rather than the HoloNet in order to make their communications harder to detect and trace.</Description>

A sophisticated subspace receiver, the hyperwave signal interceptor (HSI) is designed to covertly listen in on communications sent through the HoloNet or by hypertransceivers. Capable of scanning a broad band of subspace frequencies, an HSI can detect and pick up nearly any hypercommunications originating with ten light years of the receiver. Additionally, since they can detect even the smallest fluctuations in hyperspace, they can be used by skilled operators to track vessels through hyperspace, providing several minutes' warning prior to a ship exiting hyperspace or giving the user a fairly good idea of the general course and direction of a vessel in hyperspace.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]ID9 Seeker Droid[h3]
Seekers are small, repulsor-driven, Class II droids used throughout the galaxy as couriers, scouts, and occasionally assassins. The ID9 by Arakyd Industries is a perfect example of the type. These small, nimble droids look like miniature Viper probe droids. They are commonly used tby the ISB and Inquisitorius in the course of their work rooting out rebels, traitors, and Jedi. Roughly the size of a large datapad, these droids have a flat, saucer-shaped body covered in light-absorbing polycarbonate. A single large red photoreceptor surrounded by four small sensor globes is mounted on the leading edge of the saucer, and the dorsal surface is studded with antennae and sensors. Five multi-jointed limbs-three long and two short-are mounted to the droid's ventral surface. Each of these limbs is equipped with a powerful grasping claw and a short-range energy weapon that allow the little droids to knock out organics and other droids with ease.
[P]ID9 droids are not the smartest droids in the Imperial arsenal, but they make up for it with tenacity and a kind of low cunning not often seen in droids of their class. With their nearly silent repulsorlift generator, light-absorbing coating, and stealthy programming, they are well suited for sneaking and spying. Since these droids are used primarily by ISB agents and other secretive assets, most resistance operatives don't even know they exist. Those who have encountered them view them with equal parts annoyance, respect, and fear, because while they themselves are easy to deal with, their masters usually are not.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]IG-RM-series Enforcer Droid[h3]
The IG-RM series is one the the more common offshoots of Holowan Laboratories IG-series combat droids. Closely related to the IG-series assassin droids, IG-RM droids are tall, faceless, imposing constructs with broad shoulders, spindly arms, and a penchant for violence. Designed to act as bodyguards and security personnel, IG-RM droids have a heavily armored torso and programming that makes them fanatically loyal to their owners. These droids have no qualms against harming other sentients at their owners' behest, and will even throw themselves directly into harm's way to protect their masters. They tend to take orders literally and show little in the way of initiative or creative thinking. Thanks to these traits and their looming, intimidating presence, many of these droids have found their way into the employ of various crime syndicates and corrupt governments as enforcers and toughs.
[P]IG-RM droids possess no internal weaponry. They are, however, programmed to handle most known military and civilian arms. They are also programmed for close-in melee combat and grappling, which comes in handy when an opponent needs to be subdued rather than killed outright.</Description>

Derived from the extract of the nysillim plant of Felucia, impact has grown in popularity in recent years among smugglers and other starship pilots. Though nysillim spice is primarily used for its healing and palliative properties, when concentrated and cooked into impact, it has a dramatic effect on the user's reflexes. However, after a short while, the effects of the spice end in a lethargic crash. Impact use is on the rise despite Imperial attempts to crack down on the spice.

[P]A dose of impact lasts for one encounter and allows the user to upgrade the ability of any Agility based checks until the end of the encounter.

[P]Though designed for firefighting and agricultural use, Agrierd Intergalactics' InstaMist generator has found a place in the arsenals of some combatants who use it to create ambushes or make quick escapes. When loaded with a specially designed high-pressure mist cartridge and triggered, the InstaMist generator creates clouds of dense vapor. The vapor conceals the user (and anyone else nearby), providing an edge in both offensive and defensive situations. Other cartidges designed for use with the InstaMist generator create mists that can extinguish fires, generate humidity, or dispense pest control agents, but these tend to be separate, specialized products.
[P]As an action, a character may activate an InstaMist generator to fill an area out to short range of the generator with a heavy fog. As described on page 219 of the [B]Force and Destiny[b] core rulebook, heavy fog adds [SE][SE][SE] to Ranged (Light), Ranged (Heavy), Gunnery and Perception checks against targets obscured by it, and adds [Bo][BO][BO] to Stealth checks made by characters concealed by it. The heavy fog lasts for three rounds. At the GM's discretion, windy conditions can cause it to become fog or mist or reduce the time it takes for the vapor to disperse entirely.
[P]The generator comes wiht five vapor cartridges. Additional vapor cartridges cost 10 credits each, and other cartidges vary in price based on their function.      </Description>

[P]Skilled artisans in the employ of the Jedi Order designed a utility belt for the use of Jedi Knights in the field centuries ago,  incorporating a number of useful tools and items of fine manufacture. Jedi utility belts are visually nondescript, and the pouches worn on them, as well as the compartments within them, contain a number of useful items and tools. These utility belts were not worn by every Jedi Knight in the field, but many found them to be useful, so various iterations and models stayed in circulation throughout the centuries.
[P]While Jedi utility belts found in circulation or on abandoned battlefields are typically empty, having long ago been picked over, Jedi caches have been known to contain Jedi utility belts that are still supplied. A Jedi utility belt contains a three-day supply of food capsules, an emergency medpac, a Jedi multitool, a slim glow rod, a comlink, and an aquata breather. A number of empty pouches are concealed along the belt's interior side, allowing the wearer to hide small items. In addition, a standard lightsaber can be securely hung from the belt for easy access.
[P]In addition to potentially containing the supplies listed above, the Jedi utility belt increases the wearer's encumberance threshold by 1.</Description>

This rare spice is well known for its properties as a powerful painkiller and for the degenerative toxins that build up in long-term users. Underworld pushers frequently attempt to sell it instead of medicine, knowning it supresses most symptoms of illness long enough to appear effective, while doing nothing to cure the customers of their need for its "treatment". As if this practice were not repugnant enough, the spice has another, less-known property  that offers another venue for exploitation; karrak spice suppresses Force abilities in those who take it. This property is tracked byy the Imperial Science Bureau, which is working on new ways to refine or duplicate it.

      [H3]Karrak Spice[h3]
This rare spice is well known for its properties as a powerful painkiller and for the degenerative toxins that build up in long-term users. Underworld pushers frequently attempt to sell it instead of medicine, knowning it supresses most symptoms of illness long enough to appear effective, while doing nothing to cure the customers of their need for its "treatment". As if this practice were not repugnant enough, the spice has another, less-known property  that offers another venue for exploitation; karrak spice suppresses Force abilities in those who take it. This property is tracked byy the Imperial Science Bureau, which is working on new ways to refine or duplicate it. The ISB has also developed improved froms of the spice that are sometimes issued to Imperial agents hoping to capture a Force-using target.

      [H3]"Knack" Restraining Bolt[h3]

The Brennkeyes Syndicate remains among one of the most wanted criminal production industries, and survives only due to constant relocation and intense security regarding its manufacturing methods. The craftsmanship and ingenuity of its wares remains matched only by their corresponding illegality, leading to further inflated prices. The "Knack" restraining bolt has become one of their most popular standard items. It appears just like a standard restraining bolt. However, the 'Knack' can also be preprogrammed with an order that will be relayed to the droid at certain times or based on specified triggers.

[P]This secret order might simply let the druid ignore the bolt under particular circumstances, or it might enable something more sinister, such as causing the droid to plot a course to a pirate base when its owner directs it to navigate to Coruscant. The programming can be detected only by accessing the restraining bolt through a datapad, and is not visible to anyone examining the druid's programming rather than that of the restraining bolt.

[P]A PC droid can try to resist a "Knack" restraining bolt in the same way as a normal restraining bolt (see page 195 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook).</Description>

Arakyd Industries' KX-series enforcer droids are a rarity in the Empire's armed forces. While droids in general are quite common in the Imperial military, those programmed for combat or other warlike functions are largely unheard of. General distrust of Class IV droids throughout the galaxy, plus the debacle of the dark trooper program, has soured the Joint Chiefs on the use of combat droids. One exception to this rule, however, is the Imperial Army's KX-series.
[P]Officially classified as security droids, KX-series droids are general-purpose units used in roles ranging from combat support to security to frontline battle. They stand just over two meters tall, with broad shoulders; long, thin limbs; and a skull-like head with two piercing white optical sensors. Their bodies are covered in dark gunmetal armor and an integrated back-mounted combat computer gives them an almost hunchbacked posture. Rigorously controlled and monitored, these droids are subjected to all appropriate service and maintenance, which gives them little opportunity to develop individual personalities. What little personality they do have is cool, commanding, and menacing. Extremely single-minded, they are quite difficult to bluff or distract from their given mission. Their humanoid form also means they can be equipped with almost any weapon a human could use.
[P]KX-series droids are a priority target for insurgents. Rebel leadershiphas put a bounty on their capture, and at least one cell has a KX among its membership that acts as an infiltrator and spy.</Description>

Life since the fall of the Republic has grown difficult for the Lasat. The Empire exterminated them in droves, a gruesome example to those who seek to rebel. Many Lasat now search for meaning in an existence that seems to only want them destroyed. Many turn to their species' most ancient teachings in hopes of finding some parallels, some guidance for a people adrift. One of the most frequent resources for this study has been the Chronicles of the Three. This collection of ancient parables follows the three Lasan mythic archetypes: the Child, the Fool, and the Warrior.
[P]When a character studies the Chronicles, they may use Perception, Knowledge (Lore), or Discipline to decipher it. They must then spend an hour studying the Chronicles, succeeding at a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) check[b]  of the appropriate skill at the end of it. Depending on their chosen skill. they receive a unique bonus that can be used once during the remainder of the session. Knowledge (Lore) grants the Perspicacity of the Child , whose desire to learn outstrips all else. The character may add [BO] to any one Knowledge skill check they make. Perception gives them the Insight of the Fool: in knowing nothing, they see everything. Once, when making a combat skill check, they may re-roll one [AB] of their choice. Using Discipline leaves them with the Purpose of the Warrior, whose devotion and tenacity overcomes all obstacles. They may remove [SE] on a single skill check that they make.</Description>

Lesai is a variety of spice that is not mined, but grown in a fungus found only on certain kinds of lizards from the planets Zebitrope IV and VIII. By harvesting the distinctive purple mold and applying it underneath the jaw, members of many sentient species can eliminate their need to sleep. The stains that the fungus leaves are hard to disguise, but it has few other confirmed side-effects. Most species become psychologically if not physically dependent on the drug very quickly, however, and users who miss a dose frequently collapse and only awake days later.

[P]A character who partakes in lesai at least once every twenty-four hours does not need to sleep, and suffers no penalties or strain for lack of sleep. The character may remove strain as if he had slept a full night after any period of eight or more hours in which he did not engage in any stressful activities (such as combat, intense mental effort, or emotionally charged discussion). Lesai's only noticeable side-effect is that it leaves odd purple stains where applied. If a character under the effects of lesai ever goes twenty-four full hours without a dose of the drug, he finds it increasingly difficult to stay awake until he receives more lesai or sleeps. Some Imperial officials claim that lesai turns users into amoral monsters without feelings or compassion. Whether this is true or not is entirely up to the GM, and he should feel free to keep his decision secret from any players whose characters use lesai.

A more powerful variant of Idellian Arrays's ILF-5000, the ILF-6500 is one of the most powerful long-range, omnidirectional life-form scanners on the market. With a database containing information on thousands of known species of wildlife and with space for recording new data, the ILF-6500 is most often used as the center of a security perimeter for scout or hunting encampments. Mounted on a telescoping tripod that can extend up to three meters and capable of monitoring an area nearly half a kilometer across depending on terrain and vegetation, this scanner can track and identify up to two dozen targets at a time, categorize and rank them in order of threat level, and alert its operators either by sending updates to their datapads or sounding a shrill alarm.

[P]Setting up the ILF-6500 requires either an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Survival check[b] or a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Education[b] or [B]Computers[b] check to ensure that the device is properly calibrated and located in the best possible area for taking full advantage of its scanning capabilities. </Description>

      [H3]Long Range Terrain Scanner[h3]

A variation on CryonCorp's successful EnhanceScan personal-scanner line of products, the Long-Range Terrain Scanner was developed with the professional explorer in mind. The LRTS uses a limited-power ground-following radar of the kind typically found on military airspeeders for low-level instrument flying. Typically mounted to slow-flying airspeeders or small landspeeders with a reasonably high maximum altitude, the LRTS allows a scouting team to make a comprehensive topographical map of a new planet quickly and efficiently. The radar transceiver is mated to a broadband sensor suite and mapping program that takes in billions of bits of data per second. In game terms, the LRTS has a range of long and can map quite a large area of ground in a single pass. Depending on the atmospheric conditions, the size of the area being mapped, and numerous other variables, the time required to thoroughly map an area can take from a few hours to a few days of concentrated effort.
[P]Successfully using the LRTS requires an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Computers check[b] on the part of the operator. Maps produced with the LRTS add [BO] to any Survival check made to navigate using the map plus an automatic [SU] for every two [AD] gained on the Computers check. </Description>

[P]Luma flares are rocket propelled illumination devices commonly used by both militaries and survivalists. Luma flares excel at illuminating dark areas, as their detonation spreads a luminous compound over a wide blast area. They are also popular as signaling devices, especially when used to attract the attention of search and rescue teams.
[P]Each luma flare is a self contained device with limited guidance capability. The flare's simple controls allow the user to guide its rough trajectory, as well as to adjust the blast's detonation point based on the desired altitude. A safety is included, which generally precents the flare from igniting before the rocket reaches its destination.
[P]As an action, a character may make an [B]Easy (DI) Gunnery check[b] to launch a luma flare into the air to provide light. Uf he succeeds and the flare has room to travel into the air, he flare completely illuminates an area out to long range from the location it was fired. If he fails or does not have room to fire it, the flare still ignites, but does not travel into the air. Instead it remainds at ground level, illuminating an area out to short range. Whether he succeeds or fails, the flare's illumination continues for five rounds, after which time it burns out.
[P]Though Luma flares are not designed as weapons, creative characters can nonetheless use them as such. They are extremely hard to aim, but the mere prospect of being struck with one will cause many foes to reconsider attacking. They have the following profile as a weapon: luma flare (Gunnery) Damage 6, Critical 3, Range Long, Blast 4, Burn 4, Disorient 2, Inaccurate 2, Prepare 2, Limited Ammo 1.

[P]Though the sizes of these safes vary, most store about 10 encumbrance. Cracking a magna-safe requires specialized tools, and even with these, opening it requires a [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI]) Skulduggery check[b].

      [H3]Marksman-H Combat Training Remote[h3]
[P]Also referred to as a "seeker droid" or "training remote", the MArksman-H by Industrial Automation is a versatile little droid that has found many niches, some of them unintended. This model of droid is employed variously as a basic security unit, a training tool, a pest controller, and even as a tiny assassin. Individuals the galaxy over continue to find new and innovative uses for this versatile droid.
[P]Some Jedi once preferred the Marksman-H as a training tool when teaching Padawans to reflect blaster bolts with their lightsabers. Even after the fall of the Jedi Order, some of these same droids remain active. A Marksman-H can be a tenacious opponent. It respondds to a handheld signaleer which transmits high-pitched bursts of coded data, and can be programmed to receive verbal commands.
[P]The Marksman-H is a small, spherical droid only fifteen centimeters in diameter. Its tiny repulsorlift unit propels it in seemingly random directions without warning, making it hard to track. Studded with a number of emitter nozzles which are factory-equipped with micro stun blasters, these droids are commonly programmed for use as security drones.

There are countless macrobinocular brands on the market, though most of the differences are purely cosmetic.

Essentially a scaled-up medpac, the ECM-598 contains a clinic's worth of medical equipment, drugs, tools, scanners, and other contents needed to keep a team of explorers alive in the field. All of this equipment is securely packed into a sturdy internal-frame backpack.

The ECM-598 even includes a collapsible repulsor stretcher with a weight limit of 150 kilograms for evacuating seriously wounded personnel.

[P]The ECM-598 medical backpack allows characters to attempt to heal others using Medicine checks without penalty, as detailed on page 219 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rulebook. In addition, it grants [BO] to all Medicine checks made while using the ECM-598 and, thanks to the tutorials and information on the datapad, individuals using this decrease the difficulty of any Medicine checks they make to heal Critical Injuries by 1 to a minimum of Easy ([DI]).</Description>

While it is known primarly as a producer of starfighter navicomputers, such as the powerful LpM-549 used on the Alliance's B-wing heavy attack fighters. It also produces a number of other navigation related products. Microaxial's products have a reputation as rugged, reliable, and easy to maintain, a reputation the company works very hard to maintain through excellent manufacturing and service.
[P]The Starmapper is a small, dedicated-use datapad designed to assist a starship's navigator in plotting courses and performing, the tricky math of hyperspace navigation. Within its prodigious memory, the Starmapper contains hyperspace and realspace maps of every known region of the galaxy. These maps are annotated and well organized, allowing a user to find a given map or star chart in an instant. Through its permanent connection to the galactic HoloNet, the Starmapper constantly upgrades its maps and charts as changes are made by the Imperial Survey Corps and by various regional and planetary survey bureaus. In addition, a Starmapper user can make changes to an existing chart and upload those changes to the HoloNet, from which other users can retrieve them and change their charts accordingly. This ensures that Starmapper users always have the latest navigational data available to them. Using a Starmapper Handheld Navicomputer grants a character [BO][BO] to all Astrogation checks. Game Masters can reduce this to [BO] or eliminate the bonus altogether if the character using the Starmapper has been out of HoloNet range for an extended period of time.</Description>

    <Description>
      [H3]Model 40 Field Repulsor Hoist[h3]
The Model 40 field repulsor hoist began life as a field-expedient (aka jury-rigged) vehicle maintenance lift designed by Alliance Army mechanic Lidiah Alexakis. It is a simple device that uses small, low-output repulsors to lift a broken-down vehicle so that it can
be moved, towed, and repaired more easily. The first field repulsor hoist (FRH) was little more than a handful of mismatched repulsor coils mated to some magnetic work clamps and controlled by a homemade control box. It soon spread to motor pools and bases throughout the sector as Sgt. Alexakis worked to perfect it. Eventually, after coming to the attention of Alliance Military R&amp;D, the final version of the device was put into production as the Model 40.
[P]Production hoists consist of a set of six fist-sized lifting units that contain a repulsor coil, a power cell, and either a powerful magnet or a multi-adhesive pad. The lifting units are packed in to a shock-resistant, environmentally sealed carrying case along with a handheld control unit. To use the Model 40, an engineer simply attaches the lifting units to a vehicle or machine. Using the control unit, the trooper can move or lift the vehicle safely and effortlessly.
[P]The Model 40 can lift a vehicle as large as silhouette 4 up to two meters off the ground. When suspended, the vehicle can be pushed, pulled, or rotated (slowly) in any direction via an Athletics check with a difficulty equal to the vehicle's silhouette.</Description>

      [H3]Modular Backpack[h3]

The convenient Mk. IV Modular Backpack is manufactured by Creshaldyne Industries and marketed almost exclusively to military and governmental forces. Designed with scouts, reconnaissance troopers, and explorers in mind, these backpacks are large and sturdy, made from weatherproof textiles and equipped with an internal frame to help support the weight of the load carried. The backpack has one large compartment with four smaller compartments on the exterior. Each compartment can be sealed and unsealed quickly with a specially designed, silent tear-away textile sealer that keeps the contents of the backpack safe, secure, and dry. What makes this backpack unique is the number of different pouches that can be purchased and attached to the exterior by way of Creshaldyne's proprietary modular quick-release system. This allows the user to customize his backpack for the job at hand, adding extra pouches for contents like ammunition, optical equipment, or specialized hunting gear.

[P]The Mk. IV Modular Backpack increases the user's encumbrance threshold by 3, plus an additional 1 point of encumbrance threshold for each accessory pouch to a maximum of 3.

[P][B]Note:[b] To purchase accessory pouches for the modular backpack, select the backpack in your inventory and click the "Attachments" button.  An "attachment" will be available for adding the pouches to the backpack.</Description>

     [P]Despite their amphibious nature, the Mon Calamari have long made use of a symbiotic blob to breathe underwater for extended periods of time. Developed in their own laboratories from cloned tissue taken from a breed of jellyfish indigenous to Mon Cala, these blobs are referred to as organic gills. When placed over an individual’s nose and mouth (or equivalent), the symbiote filters oxygen from the ocean water. Organic gills are capable of lasting for several weeks in the water before they begin to die.
[P]Wearing an organic gill prevents speech, but this drawback can be alleviated by the introduction of small, waterproof microphones and earphones into the blob. Most species can wear the organic gill easily, as long as they breathe an atmosphere similar to that of the Mon Calamari. Sullustans, however, have demonstrated an allergic reaction to the gills, which prevents their species from employing them.</Description>

The ubiquitous MSE-series "mouse droids" are so common in the galaxy's starships and spaceports as to be nearly invisible. Designed by Rebaxan Columni decades before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, these tiny, boxy droids were produced by the billions. Closer in intellect and utility to a remote than to a full droid, they are equipped with a low-powered, single-function droid brain that can contain a single program at a time. These programs can be switched out with ease, making the droids surprisingly versatile. This versatility is hampered, however, by the droid's lack of intellect, creativity, and problem-solving abilities.
[P]Mouse droids are largely used in maintenance and custodial roles aboard ships and in military installations. With their three retractable manipulators and a surprisingly excellent sensor package, they excel at basic mechanical and electrical repair, and at cleaning, scraping, painting, and otherwise carry out the drudgery of keeping a starship ship-shape. They also make remarkably good security and communications droids, keeping watch over sensitive areas, carrying encrypted messages, or even acting as tools in espionage efforts.</Description>

An individual with a neural recorder installed gains the ability to record and store sensory information with the veracity and recall of an advanced computer system. The recorder's recall is not truly perfect, as most known species have sensory limitations that prevent them from uploading perfectly detailed information on everything they observe, but it is still the next-best thing to a perfect memory. The recorder only captures information that the user consciously chooses to record but after a short period of adjustment, keeping it running in the absence of concern for privacy or security becomes second nature.
[P]Neural recorders allow the user to make an [B]Easy ([DI]) Discipline check[b] to recall any information experienced while the recorder was running. Information gained from this check is highly detailed and is generally comparable in quality to the recording of a standard holorecorder would make. The installation of a neural recorder usually inludes a small connection port elsewhere on the user's body - typically the palm. A character with a neural recorder can copy information recorded by the implant to a more common type of external storage device using this connection.</Description>

      [H3]OR-Series Tech Recycling Station[h3]
Tech recycling stations are used to speed up the time consuming task of sifting through damaged or discarded technology to find items of value. High-grade examples are sometimes used by archaeological expeditions but the more common OR-Series is typical of models in service everywhere from the recycling plants of environmental concerns to the warehouses of Outer Rim scrap dealers. The OR-Series sorts through loads of junked technology to find vaulable quality alloys, active power cells and useful parts that can be separated from the trash surrounding them.
[P]A character using a tech recycling station adds [BO][BO] to Perception and Mechanics checks to scavenge parts or raw materials and can complete such checks in hald the time (or one quarter of the time with the Utinni! talent). Additionally, a character with a tech recycling station on hand may recover supplies worth hald the Material Price from any failed crafting checks, to a maximum of the full value (see [B]Crafting[b] on page 74).</Description>

While Polis Massans are capable of communicating telepathically, many individuals or other species find it unsettling unless they are accustomed to it. In cases in which a Polis Massan wishes to grant the utmost courtesy to a guest or associate, small electronic voiceboxes are used.
[P]Translation of a Polis Massans thoughts into speech through the voicebox is accomplished through a simple neural connection, which is established via a set of noninvasive electrodes. The voicebox can adopt any one of a number of preprogrammed voice patterns, though the default voice is largely mechanical and not unlike a droid’s. The device’s volume can be modulated with a thought. Polis Massans who use voiceboxes to communicate on a regular basis often attach them to their bodysuits for ready accessibility.

By means of a painstakingly constructed hinge, the wearer can access the tiny space within. Any substance could be concealed in the space, but most commonly, it is used to carry a dose of deadly poison. With carefully practiced motions, the wearer can deposit the fatal cargo into a cup, plate, or bowl with little chance of being noticed.

[P]A poisoner's ring can hold a single dose of any poison (such as those on page 182 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook, or any other poison the GM deems appropriate). As an action, a character wearing the ring may make an opposed Skulduggery check against any onlookers' Vigilance to deposit the contents into a target's meal or beverage without being noticed.

Made of sturdy textiles and supported by a unique flexible internal frame, it packs easily, sets up quickly, and provides more than adequate protection from even the harshest environments. The advanced textiles that compose the structure have a natural heat-exchanging property that keeps the interior of the shelter at a constant comfortable temperature no matter what the external temperature is. The shelter is weatherproof, and a special foil-fiber mesh is woven into the fabric that makes it flameproof and able to withstand lightning strikes. portable survival shelters are also equipped with a water-reclamation system that is designed to double a user's carried water supplies. When stowed, these items are about the size of a large datapad and pack easily in a backpack, pannier, or shoulder bag. Unfolding the shelter makes it spring immediately to shape, and within the span of a minute it is ready for use.</Description>

      [H3]Personal Stealth Field[h3]

Personal stealth fields, as the name suggests, are miniaturized stealth fields that allow their user to vanish from the sight of organic creatures and droids without sufficiently acute optics. Most of them are relics of an age long-past, though several contemporary efforts have been made by various military organizations to recreate this technology.

[P]While they are undeniably effective for those who wish to pass unnoticed, the major flaw of most personalized stealth fields is that they are prone to collapsing. Scientists have theorized that this may be an unavoidable result of miniaturizing technology meant for starships, a design flaw, or a result of many of the active devices being antiques. In any case, few are lucky enough to possess one of these devices, and their infamous unreliability makes many prospective users wary. When using this device, it is impossible to see the user visually. In addition, any checks to ascertain the user's location by other means (such as hearing, smell, or observing the surrounding environment) have their difficulty set at [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI])[b].

[P][B]Restrictions:[b] Personalized stealth fields are vanishingly rare, and so few governments bother to place restrictions on their use. Some are legitimate artifacts of ages past, while others are stolen military technology, and the particulars of their creation dictate their legality. Of course, law enforcement officers tend not to see these fine distinctions when apprehending people using them to commit crimes.</Description>

    <Description>
      [H3]DefenStar Ltd. PSF Mk III Power Fence[h3]
Power fences are specialized shield emitters designed to provide perimeter protection for civilian and military installations. Power fences all have a field generator at their heart. Similar to shield generators found on starships, power fence generators produce a wall of energy that prevents objects and energy beams from passing through it. Each generator is hooked up to a series of thin durasteel amplifier pylons with flared stresscrete bases that come in heights of up to five meters. Once activated, the generators produce walls of crackling, translucent, blue-white energy that extend between the pylons, creating a solid barrier. Power fences are typically flanked with an alloy or plascrete gate, vehicle obstacles, and weapon emplacements to provide perimeter security at both Alliance and Imperial military installations.
[P]The PSF Mk III power fence by DefenStar Ltd. is a popular small-scale power fence perfect for defending small platoon or company-sized installations. It comes complete with a high-output PFL-99 Barricade power fence generator and twenty amplification pylons, each four meters tall.
[P]Power fences can be destroyed by either attacking the energy walls with ion weapons or by attacking the amplification pylons with regular energy or slugthrowing weapons. When attacked, power fences have the following profile: Defense 2, Armor I, Wound Threshold (pylons) 15, Strain Threshold (energy wall) 20.</Description>

      [H3]PTP Link[h3]
A PTP (or point-to-point) link is a multichannel personal communications device capable of transmitting audio signals up to twenty-five kilometers. Available in a wide variety of sizes and styles, PTP links were used extensively during the time of the Republic. As more powerful methods of telecommunications grew popular, PTP links became obsolete.
[P]Despite the obsolescence of PTP links, PTP transmission boosters and relays were installed on a number of Core Worlds, and they are still used exclusively on low-tech worlds the galaxy over. Because most modern communications devices are unable to pick up PTP transmissions, the Rebel Alliance often uses them in order to avoid Imperial eavesdropping. With the addition of PTP encryption devices, which can cost up to 1,000 credits, this archaic transmission format is almost undetectable.

The ChandrilTech PX-7 heat sensor used to detect anomalous variations in temperature nearby. This is useful for finding heat-emitting life forms and isolating certain kinds of damage in machines. These devices are especially helpful for any task that combines the two, such as locating vermin infestations in the hull of a star ship. Many ships have had critical hardware failures at inopportune times due to the presence of mynocks or other invasive lifeforms that damage wiring, power cells, and more, and so veteran spacers know the value of running a heat-sensor sweep ove their ship from time to time, just to be sure nothing has taken up residence in the craft's hull.
[P]A PX-7 heat sensor adds [BO][BO] to Perception checks to find heat-emitting objects within short range and adds [BO] to Mechanics checks to remove Critical Hits from starships and Critical Injuries from droids.   </Description>

Developed in cooperation with CorChemCo,  SmartTranq is an adaptable synthetic tranquilizer designed to be used with the Model 77 Air Rifle. When the tranquilizer enters the bloodstream of a target, it immediately begins to mutate, changing constantly and reconfiguring itself to find the quickest, most efficient way to overwhelm the target's defensive systems and render it unconscious.

[P]Upon a successful hit with the Model 77, the target must immediately make an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Resilience check[b]. If the target fails, it suffers 5 strain, plus 2 additional strain per [TH] generated on the check. If the check generates [DE], the GM can spend it to make the target check against the tranquilizer again during the next round. If the GM does so, increase the difficulty of the check by one.

[P]Equipping the Model 77 with SmartTranq costs 500 credits. This does not change the weapon's profile—it simply adds the above special rule to the weapon. If the weapon ever runs out of ammo, the user must purchase a reload (also costing 500 credits) before using the SmartTranq again.</Description>

[P]Republic Seals of Service cannot be purchased on the open market Instead, the seals are awarded by a Senatorial committee for exemplary service to the Republic. The rarity listed indicates the relative infrequency of encountering these seals.

      [H3]Repulsor Assist Unit[h3]
Som models of grappling hook and climbing harness rely on forces other than sheer muscle power for operation Repulsor assist units use a miniatureized repulsorlift generator to make whatever they bear nearly weightless, be it a live user climbing a sheer wall, or a bale of cargo attached to the integrated hook via magnets clamp and hauled up by retractable cables. A typical model is highly compact, consisting of a small metal case that stores bothe the wound up cables and the lift generator, with a small hook or magnetic clamp clpped to the side.
[P]A character using a repulsor assist unit reduces the difficulty to climb by 2 (to a minimum of 0). A repulsor assist unit can also be attached to a cargo to reduce the encbrance value of the cargo by 7.</Description>

      [H3]Restraining Bolt[h3]

Restraining bolts serve the same function on droids as restraints do on other sentients. Once affixed to a droid, the bolts can override their programming. The simplest setting shuts the droid down, but restraining bolts can also force droids to perform any actions they are commanded to do by the person holding the restraining bolt controller. Standard restraining bolts are produced by the billions by companies like Industrial Automation.

[P]Most droids cannot resist restraining bolts when one is attached to them (a process that requires a few seconds and a spot-welder). However, any Player Character who happens to be a droid is obviously made of sterner stuff than NPC droids. Player Character droids may make a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Discipline check[b] to overcome the effects of a restraining bolt and act normally when the bolt is applied. They may retry the test at the GM's discretion.

Riding tack includes a sturdy comfortable saddle designed for a specific beast and riding style, stirrups, headgear (bridle, halter, bit, reins, etc,), and a breastplate. Tack made for working animals replaces the saddle with a heavy duty harness that allows a creature to pull cargo sleds or implements such as plows.
[P]Tack can only be worn by riding or working animals. Using tack allows a character to ride the beast without suffering the bareback riding penalties detailed on page 73.
[P][I]Note: This tack can also be found as an attachment for a mount vehicle.

Originally sold in bulk to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Bulldogs were carried by heavy-support B1 battle droids as anti-materiel and light anti-armor weapons. They were used to great effect against the Grand Army of the Republic's heavily armored clone troopers and fighting vehicles, and gained a fearsome reputation among the CIS's foes.

The ability to turn a leap into an extended flight at will offers a tremendous level of tactical versatility. If an opponent fails to recognize this capacity, then the advantage becomes even more substantial. Rocket boots enable an individual to take flight on a whim, without being as bulky or as obvious as a jetpack.
[P]The convenience of their smaller size comes at a cost, however. Rocket boots cannot operate for extended periods, due to their limited cooling capacity. Furthermore, as they are worn far from a beings center of gravity, they are far more difficult to control.
[P]Rocket boots enable a person to function as a Silhoette 1, Speed 1, Handling -3, System Strain Threshold 3 vehicle that can only operate in atmosphere, and requires Piloting (Planetary) to operate. At the end of each round of activation, the rocket boots suffer 1 system strain as their fuel depletes.

External optics provide a 360-degree view around the bearer, and this imagery can be beamed to any communications device within range, or shared with the combat scanners worn by other members of the unit. The Chedak Mark 6 is integrated into a combat helmet with visor.

[P]The Mark 6 offers some of the features of a general purpose scanner, scanner goggles for night-vision capability, and a corn scrambler.

      [H3]Scanner Goggles[h3]

Simpler than electrobinoculars, scanner goggles enhance vision through a blend of light amplification and thermal imaging. They are common in illegal and combat situations, as they do not require extra effort or hands for their operation.

[P]Scanner goggles allow the user to see normally in dark conditions.

      [H3]Scramble Key[h3]
Breaking into a facility secured with an electronic lock usually requires a knowledgeable slicer, but the galactic underworld has invented myriad ways to perform the task in the absence of such personnel. Scramble keys, also called lottery keys or luckbreakers, are one such tool. Scramble keys interact with electronic locks that require a password or code input to open. instead of providing or faking the legitimate entry code, scremble keys cycle through  possible codes at incredible speeds, offering up a barrage of possible matches in fractions of a second.
[P]The processing power is usch that they are typically able to generate potential matches faster than they can input all of them. Some criminals alim that it is possible to notice when a scramble key generates the correct code through faint tremors or bussing in the device, even if the key has not yet input this code, and that they can adjust the controls to allow them to select the correct code for immediate input. This procedure can be less effective, but could save valuable time if the operator's hunch is correct. many Force-sensitive users find they have a special knack for this approach and can intuitively select correct codes with ease.
[P]A scramble key bypasses most simple electronic locks within five minutes of application. At the Game Master's discretion, more complicated locks may require additional time to crack or might trigger alarms at the brute force incursion. The user may attempt to speed up this process with a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Skulduggery check[b], relying on pure intuition to select the correct code from thsoe the scramble key generates. Success reduces the time needed to crack a common lock to a single minute, but failure immediately triggers any relevant alarms. Force-sensitive characters may make a Force power check as part of this check, adding either  [SU] or [AD] for each [FP] generated.</Description>

Made of durasteel with an attached heavy chain and secured with a magnolock, these collars are designed to be escape-proof and tamper-resistant. Attempts to remove the collar without the proper circuit key results in a painful, potentially lethal neural shock to the wearer. Some variants come with biomet-ric or voice-activated locking systems.

[P]Safely removing a Thalassian security collar without use of the proper key requires a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Skulduggery check[b]. If a character fails this check, the wearer suffers 2 strain and 1 wound (this ignores soak), and becomes Disoriented for 5 rounds.

Government officials and military personnel must maintain a vigilant guard against espionage, taking greats pains to ensure they are not being overheard or recorded. The world of intelligence and counterintelligence fluctuates as recorders become more complex and more difficult to detect, and sweepers advance to keep up with them. Security sweepers are optimized to detect specialized electronic components, ignoring mundane devices such as holocams or datapads. Security sweepers precisely locate recorders and listening devices, but they typically cannot identify the exact nature of any such device.

[P]A character using a security sweeper may check an area for espionage tools by making an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Computers check[b]. If he succeeds, the device notifies him of the presence and location of any recording or espionage devices within medium range of his current location. If the device is particularly well-hidden, this check might be opposed by the Mechanics skill of the character who placed the device.

      [H3]Shadowcloak[h3]

Shadowcloaks are peculiar devices designed to protect a user's anonymity during meetings in person. When activated, a shadowcloak generates a field of concealing darkness around its user, causing him to appear as nothing more than a black mass of shadows, even in bright light. In addition to hiding the user from sight, the shadowcloak field also baffles most sensors and scanners, and distorts the user's voice, ensuring his identity remains a secret. The shadowcloak field is relatively static and inflexible once activated, and the user cannot walk or move around too much without revealing his identity. Additionally, the power requirements of the field only allow the device to operate for an hour before it must cool down and recharge for four hours. Normally, the user will sit down somewhere and activate the shadowcloak just prior to a meeting.

[P]Discerning any identifiable features of a character wearing a shadowcloak requires a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b].

Also called "Bith hiding cubes," these transparisteel cubes are about three-quarters of a meter on each side, and function as small safes designed to be invisible to the naked eye. Originally designed by Bith engineers, the walls of the coffer contain special fiber optic relays that transfer the light around the cube across its surface. When placed flush into a niche in a wall, the shift coffer disappears, blending perfectly into the surrounding plane of the wall. When out in the open, the coffer refracts light around itself but creates an odd blurring effect akin to heat haze.

[P]Shift coffers can contain up to a total 5 encumbrance in items, though items more than about half a meter in length do not fit inside (at least, not without being bent or folded). When the coffer is in its wall niche, attempts to discover it require a successful [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b].

Originally produced for Corellian Security (CorSec) intelligence agents by Chiewab Amalgamated Pharmaceuticals, Skirtopanol is a powerful truth serum used to coerce confessions out of suspects. Administered through injection, Skirtopanol typically takes effect in minutes. It makes the target lethargic, compliant, open to suggestion, and free with information. While under the influence of Skirtopanol, suspects tend to ramble, chase tangents, and trail off in the middle of sentences. Agents must work constantly to keep an interrogation on track when using Skirtopanol, but it typically is worth the effort. Interrogators must also closely monitor the amount of Skirtopanol injected, as an overdose can cause coma and permanent cognitive impairment. Courts frown on law enforcement agencies using Skirtopanol due to the suggestibility of individuals under its influence, and confessions extracted from subjects under its effects are often ruled as inadmissible.
[P]One dose of Skirtopanol requires a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Resilience check[b] to overcome. On a failed check, the drug inflicts 5 strain, and the difficulty of all checks the target makes to resist Charm or Coercion for the remainder of the encounter is upgraded once. In addition, each [TH] generated on the original check inflicts 2 strain on the target.

      [H3]Sleight Box[h3]

A favorite of smugglers and spies everywhere, the sleight box is a crate or box modified for hiding cargo. Using a low-power repulsorlift coil and matrix, a long-lasting battery, and a false bottom, the sleight box, when weighed or visually inspected, appears to be empty. Although typically made in smaller size to hide weapons, drugs, or other contraband, larger models for more heavyweight materials have been made.

[P]Sleight boxes can vary in size from Encumbrance 2 to Encumbrance 20, and each can conceal a number of items with a total Encumbrance value up to half of that amount. To find the something hidden within a sleight box, a character must make a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b]. At the GM's discretion, an unaware character might use Vigilance instead.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]Slicewire[h3]
Slicewire is a multipurpose cutting tool and makeshift weapon in common use among the galaxy's intelligence services. A standard-issue slicewire is a meter-long monofilament cable contained within a carbonite rod. With a twist, the rod splits in half and releases the monofilament, with the rod halves serving as handles. Thanks to the unique properties of monofilament, a slicewire can cut through nearly any material, from flesh and bone to duranium and plasteel. Also available on spools in lengths of up to one hundred meters, slicewire can be used to create deadly traps and snares and may be strung across corridors or alleys at neck height to catch pursuers unaware. Slicewire is typically only issued to the most experienced agents, as its use poses as much of a threat to the user as it does to the target.
[P]Slicewire comes in small spools containing ten meters of wire. When used as a weapon, slicewire has the following profile: (Brawl; Damage +2; Critical 2; Range (Engaged); Pierce 2, Vicious 3). If a user fails a Brawl check when using this weapon, the Game Master can spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] to inflict the weapon's full damage onto the user.</Description>

Slicers use their formidable talents to gain access and control of computers, and items such as these are their main tools. Their main weapons are highly customized (usually to illegal degrees) computers of their own, filled with the latest decryption software, codebreakers, and data probes. Other items might include false credit chips for accessing the accounts of others or modifying monetary levels. But like slicers themselves, their tools are unique; often a slicer can identify another slicer simply by inspecting the electronic fingerprints his tools leave behind.

Using technology originally designed to minimize the constant background noise of a crowded metropolis, Veslox Corporation ingeniously realized the effect could be localized, and their sound dampener quickly became a bestseller in the criminal underworld. Small enough to be worn on a belt or mounted on a backpack, the device uses nearly instantaneous sound recognition to deploy sound-cancelling waves to eliminate or soften any sounds in the immediate vicinity. The sound dampener cannot cancel out a sound as loud as a blaster bolt, but it can make sounds such as footsteps virtually inaudible.

[P]The spherical dampening field extends to short range around the device; add [SE][SE] to checks to detect noise coming out of this area.

Space suits are vital for anyone who plans to travel in space. Space suits also come in handy when exterior repairs are needed between departure and arrival, or when stepping out into a totally unknown atmosphere. The TaggeCo. Standard X (actually made by a dozen secondary manufacturing and distribution factories on Kuat, Fondor, Bilbringi, and Corellia) is a popular model for numerous starships or space stations. It does not include long-term life support, but is useful for short spacewalks. It includes small thrusters to aid in movement, magboots for adhesion in weightlessness, a comlink, and microtool fittings. Like most suits, it also comes with repair packs to seal suit tears or gasket leaks.

      [H3]Spacer's Duffel[h3]

Most sentients who make their livings as common crew aboard large civilian vessels tend to be lifelong transients, wandering from ship to ship and world to world in search of employment. A spacer might serve on dozens of ships during his career and travel untold millions of light-years, his only home the crew berths of cargo ships and the hostels, bars, and entertainment districts of spaceports. Such beings tend to travel light, carrying their entire lives with them from job to job in large cylinder-shaped bags colloquially known as spacer's duffels. Roughly half the size of a grown human and featuring one large compartment, a sturdy zipper, and a single shoulder strap, spacer's duffels have become a symbol of the free-and-easy life of the common spacer. Made by many different textile and storage-technology companies, these bags are as essential a piece of kit to the survival of a spacer as his certificates and his spacesuit. Among ship captains and recruiting agents, one of the most common sights in the spacelanes is a grizzled spacer with a hopeful look on his face, approaching with his duffel slung over his shoulder to inquire about work.

[P]Spacer's duffels increase the user's encumbrance threshold by 2 but also have the Cumbersome 3 quality.</Description>

Every encounter with a new species offers the possibility of biological offense, embarrassment, or even accidental poisoning. To avoid this, many organizations equip their diplomats with custom-built datapads loaded with specific biological details of every known species. In theory, such compendiums help operatives avoid injuring a sensitive body part or inadvertently wearing a known allergen as floral decoration. Cynical individuals have noted, however, that such information can also be used for more nefarious purposes. Most species databases also contain cursory cultural notes, but the core focus of such texts is biology rather than historical or societal studies.

[P]A character using a species database adds [BO][BO] to Knowledge (Xenology) checks.

They come in all shapes and sizes, from the simple petri dish to massive, environmentally sealed and controlled containers designed to hold the largest and most lethal creatures. No matter their size, shape, or manufacture, specimen containers all possess a set of common features and systems. They are constructed from sturdy impact-resistant polymers and have secure environmentally sealed lids.

[P]They are generally transparent, the interiors of specimen containers are modular and can be configured to fit a number of small specimens or one large one. They are also usually equipped with life-support and stasis systems that allow specimens to be safely transported.

[P]Specimen containers come in four general sizes, as follows: tiny, small, medium, and large. Tiny specimen containers have an encumbrance capacity of 1 and are typically roughly the size of a human's hand. Small specimen containers have an encumbrance capacity of 3-5 and range up to the size of an R2 series astromech droid. Medium specimen containers have an encumbrance capacity of 5-10 and typically require two or more sentients to lift and carry them. Large specimen containers have an encumbrance capacity of 10-15 and are designed to carry the largest and heaviest specimens. These last containers are so large that they have their own repulsorlift generators to assist in their handling. They have a maximum altitude of roughly one meter and move as quickly as they can be pushed. </Description>

Aleena sports enthusiasts are typically credited with the integration of these extra features into the device. Sporting macrobinoculars also see use in the field of espionage. Spies can track their targets’ schedules or selectively record their prey’s actions for later review.
[P]Sporting macrobinoculars magnify objects up to five kilometers away, and can record objects viewed. They also remove [SE] imposed due to long range or poor light.</Description>

[P]Quickly immobilizing a limb injury after it happens can prevent the extremity from becoming more seriously damaged through accidental misuse. Prompt action reduces the patient's overall healing time, even though further treatment may be required before proper healing can begin. A spray plasto-cast is an easily portable tool that can be used in field conditions. When a patient suffers a serious injury, the cast reinforces the wounded limb from the outside, preventing it from bending and exacerbating the tissue damage.
[P]A character can make an [B]Easy ([DI]) Medicine check[b] to apply a spray plasto-cast to a limb that has been crippled or disabled due to a Critical Injury. If successful, the Critical Injury heals automatically after one week of narrative time.</Description>

      [H3]Synthetic Standard Anesthetic[h3]

This is a general anesthetic produced on many worlds for medical procedures, designed to render the user unconscious. Unsurprisingly, many criminals have found it valuable. This poison may be introduced into a target's body via aerosol deployment, food ingestion, or injection (via an applicator or dart). A single dose has an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) difficulty[b], while two or more doses combined into a single application have a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) difficulty[b]. The poison inflicts 5 strain if the target fails the check. If the check generates one to two [TH], the target must also give up his free maneuver during his next turn (he may still take two maneuvers, however); if it generates [TH][TH][TH] or more, he's staggered during his next turn. Finally, the GM can spend [DE] to make the target test against the poison again during the next round, as the poison remains in his system.</Description>

These small (less than three centimeters across) beacons are commonly placed on their target via darts or other surreptitious means, where they use adhesion or magnetism to stay affixed. Once in place, they relay information such as location, direction, and rate of movement to their user, making them invaluable for tracking an unwitting foe. The most expensive models, such as the Rhinsome Tracking Corp SureSnoop, can relay information through obstructions over dozens of kilometers, while the cheaper Astroserver Industries Rover and Trailmaster and the MechBlaze Observer tend to have much shorter broadcast ranges and can be blocked by large buildings or thick masses of rock or metal.

[P]It takes a maneuver for a character to inject a stimpack in himself or another..Stimpacks are one-use items, and automatically heal 5 wounds. Characters can use stimpacks more than once, but each use heals one less wound (so the second use heals four, the third use heals three, and so on). The sixth stimpack heals no wounds—the character is already oversaturated with the medicine for it to have any effect. It takes a day for the character's body to process the stimpacks and for him to be able to use them at full effectiveness. See page 220 for more information.

Sulfur is a very common element, broadly available across the galaxy. Devaronians have a unique reaction to the material. While most species find its presence noxious or even poisonous, it stimulates Devaronian physiology. Many Devaronians exploit this by placing purified sulfur in a small, pressurized air cylinder. When inhaled, the sulfur moves into the bloodstream quickly and travels throughout the body.

      [H3]Symbol of Command[h3]
Alliance Commanders hail from numerous human, nearhuman,
and alien cultures from throughout the galaxy.
From contemplative, level-headed Mon Calamari, to
cunning Bothans, to dangerously capricious humans of
every stripe, Commanders who join the Alliance bring
with them generations of their native military culture
and heritage. In most of these cultures, commanding
officers and highly ranked NCOs carry some item
about their person that represents their lawful command
over their subordinates. This could be anything
from a ceremonial saber worn with a dress uniform, to
a megaphone used to broadcast commands, to a stuncrop
used to motivate sluggish troopers. Whatever the
item, it symbolizes the power of an individual’s command,
and the Commander is rarely found without it.
[P]No matter what form the item takes, Commanders
carrying a symbol of command add [BO] to all Social
skill checks made to interact with others brought up
in their particular military culture.</Description>

[P]In some cases, an individual needs to absorb a very large amount of information in a limited amount of time. For those instances in which the user does not need to permanently retain the data, a synoptic teacher can be a vital aid. The device transfers data directly to the wearer's brain at a subconscious level. It works over the course of a single night's sleep, embedding the data in a painless and effortless fashion. Unfortunately, information implanted with this device is transient, typically lasting for only a few days.
[P]A synoptic teacher is preconfigured to teach a single skill at rank 3. A character using it must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Discipline check[b]. Success means the user counts as having that skill at rank 3 for the remainder of the game session. Failure means the user's strain threshold is halved for the remainder of the session instead. The GM can spend [DE] to cause the synoptic teacher to inflict minor neural scarring, at which point the character can no longer use the synoptic teacher.</Description>

Degan Explorations, a subsidiary of the Chiewab Amalgamated Pharmaceuticals Company, is mostly known for its vast network of professional scouts and survey crews that scour the Outer Rim for new chemical resources. In addition to their exploratory work, they are also the makers of Syntherope, a synthetic rope used in nearly every industry. Made from a mix of natural and synthetic chemicals and textiles, including the proteins found in the secretions of numerous arachnid species, Syntherope is thin, lightweight, and extremely strong, with a tensile strength ten times that of durasteel. Sold in twenty-meter spools, Syntherope is used primarily for climbing, rappelling, and securing cargo, but it can be used anywhere a good stout rope is needed. It is said that at the bottom of every backpack, pannier, and cargo crate in the Outer Rim there lies a coil of Syntherope, and while that statement is obviously hyperbole, it's also not too far from the truth.</Description>

    <Description>
      [H3]Bardottan Sphere[h3]
One of the most powerful objects ever encountered by the legendary Jedi Master Mace Windu was the Bardottan Sphere, a Force artifact designed to capture the Force from living beings and store it as though in some battery. The Sphere could focus the captured energy into a Force wielder when certain mystical and gravitational effects were applied. Now held by the Dagoyan mystics of Bardotta, the Sphere became known on that planet when Master Windu rescued the Bardottan sovereign, Queen Julia, from the clutches of the Nightsisters, an organization of dark side Force adepts.
[P]Whether the Nightsisters constructed the Sphere or discovered it is unknown, and the Bardottans have denied all requests to access the studies of the artifact that might reveal its provenance. Exhaustive records searches have found no mention of such an item either before or since Windu’s encounter with the Nightsisters. It seems likely the item is unique and was crafted by the Nightsisters or their allies shortly before its use during the events surrounding the kidnapping of Queen Julia.
[P]In appearance, the Sphere is not particularly notable. It takes the form of a large crystalline sphere of milky transparency, its color dependent on the light it reflects. It is only when a Force-sensitive being attuned to the Sphere wills it to a semblance of mineral life that the Sphere glows with an internal light and works its “magic.” When activated in this manner, the Sphere forms a link with a nearby living creature, as directed by the controlling Force sensitive. In theory, this could be any living being, as the Force surrounds and penetrates all things, but in practice, the Nightsisters and their minions seem to have chosen only sentients as their targets. Once the link has been established, the Sphere cuts off the target’s connection with the Force and then drains the Force contained within the target’s living self, leaving behind a husk bereft of life. The exact mechanisms of this process are, as with so many Force artifacts, unclear. The Sphere is obviously not mechanical in nature, and neither can it be said to be living. It has been theorized that the Sphere, when inert, is in fact a sort of anti-Force artifact, cut off from the universe and reflecting the all-surrounding Force away from itself. If this is true, say those who hold this theory, then a type of “Force vacuum” exists within the bounds of the Sphere, one that naturally attracts the Force when the Sphere becomes active.
[P]The Nightsisters did not use the Sphere as a simple tool of execution, however. The Sphere not only drains the Living Force from its victims, but also stores what it has stolen for a time. The Nightsisters could then tap into that stored Force, using it to fuel any number of Force powers to much
greater effect than they could on their own. The Bardottan Sphere, then, is a power booster for Force users, its power being purchased at the ultimate price, paid by those its users have targeted.
[P]In its history and recorded use, the Sphere of the Nightsisters has been understood as a tool of evil and murder. To be sure, there is little to suggest that it was created with anything but the literal theft of life in mind. However, at least some of the Dagoyan mystics who guard the Sphere today are said to have taken on a more curatorial role, studying the Sphere with an eye toward using its considerable powers in a benign way, more in keeping with their relatively peaceful philosophies. These Bardottans have begun to agitate for more access to the Sphere, arguing that if they can plumb its mysteries, they can control its effects, and perhaps find ways to utilize its curious binary nature as an object that sometimes reflects the Force and sometimes absorbs it. The discussion about whether to pursue this course of action usually ends there, though, as those who wish to activate the Sphere have thus far been unable to formulate detailed plans for its use that meet with the approval of Bardotta's sovereign and the Dagoyan council. The activist scholar-mystics argue that they must first be allowed greater access to the Sphere before they can provide any such details, but their requests have been denied as being too fraught with potential danger.
[P]While the Sphere is in a character’s possession, the character’s Force rating increases by one. If the character sacrifices a living being to store its life force in the Sphere, then the character’s Force rating increases by the Force rating of the sacrificed being, as long as that creature’s Force rating was 1 or higher. However, a character who uses the Sphere during a session gains 5 Conflict at the at the end of the session, in addition to any Conflict accrued due to any sacrifices the character makes to power the Sphere.

      [H3]Crown of Verity[h3]
In the days of the Republic and even before, the Outer Rim world of Auratera, little visited now, attracted the attention of Force users from all over the galaxy. Its curious day-night cycle might have been enough to interest scouts and astronomers, but it was the presence of the powerful vergence of Acablas that drew Jedi, Sith, and other Force sensitives to the planet for millennia. Over the course of Auratera’s history, such visitors had varying degrees of success in penetrating the ruins around Acablas and coming to understand its mysteries.
[P]At least one Jedi is known to have been studying Acablas on Auratera at the time of Order 66. Though he is presumed dead, the fate of the Ithorian Master Tobar Ka-Teen is unknown. What is known is that Ka-Teen had, with the permission of the Jedi Council, carried with him to Auratera a powerful and ancient Force artifact known as the Crown of Verity.
[P]In surviving Jedi records, the so-called “Crown” is actually described as a silvered skullcap capable of altering its own size and shape so that it might be worn by any sentient possessed of a discernible head. The Crown of Verity is said to have been used as a symbol of office by the Magistrates of Benetage before that Outer Rim planet was mysteriously abandoned almost thirty thousand years ago. How it came to be held in the Jedi Temple at Coruscant is unknown. Force-sensitive beings who don the Crown find themselves simultaneously able to discern any lie and unable to utter any falsehood themselves.
[P]His final, probably fatal trip to Auratera did not mark the first occasion on which Master Tobar Ka-Teen was allowed use of the Crown. His fascination with what constitutes truth had led the philosophy-minded Ithorian to make several studies of the artifact. He sought a way to duplicate its properties in other devices, and to expand and perfect the Jedi’s already considerable innate sensitivity to falsehoods.
[P]Ka-Teen’s interest in truthtelling had a dark origin. Shortly after he was named a Jedi Master, the Ithorian fell afoul of the Black Sun criminal syndicate when he inadvertently interrupted their machinations aboard Kriost Station, a deep space trading outpost. Seeking to punish the Jedi for his interference, the Black Sun placed a bounty on Master Ka-Teen’s head, hiring a deeply corrupt human woman known as Kallyx the Piner to capture him and learn everything the Jedi Order knew about Black Sun activities by any means necessary.
[P]“Piner” is an ancient and obscure term for torturer, and the weeks Tobar Ka-Teen spent under the knives of Kallyx before his rescue by fellow Jedi tested him beyond anything he had been trained for. However, to his astonishment, the gentle Ithorian found a capacity for something he had never thought possible in himself: lying.
[P]Instead of revealing anything about Jedi operations or intelligence, Master Ka-Teen successfully wove a complex net of deception that ensnared Kallyx the Piner. Seeking to protect his fellow Jedi, Ka-Teen found his only option to be what he later described as “the abandonment of truth."
[P]Despite being hailed as a hero by the Jedi Council, the Ithorian turned deeply inward following the episode, becoming an intensely private individual who spent more time alone in the libraries and archives of Coruscant than with his fellow Jedi Knights. Tobar Ka-Teen was seeking something elemental, and that search led him first to his studies of the Crown of Verity, and then, apparently, to the mysterious vergence on Auratera in the ruins of Acablas.
[P]Though he was not a general and took little part in the Clone Wars, Ka-Teen was accompanied to Auratera by several squads of Republic troops. Order 66 was enacted during his scheduled stay on the planet, and there is no reason to believe he survived its execution. However, there is no record that the clone troops “guarding” him ever returned from Auratera, either. Thus, the planet is the last known location of the Crown of Verity, and of the Jedi Master who so desperately desired to understand its secrets.
[P]A Force-sensitive character who dons the Crown of Verity automatically fails all Deception checks while wearing it. At the same time, she gains automatic [SU][SU][SU] on any checks to detect lies or determine whether someone is telling the truth.

      [H3]Dolina Ring Seeds[h3]
The swampy world of Dagobah has been erased from galactic charts, but the rare visitors of times past brought away samples of the planet’s unique flora and fauna. One example from Dagobah’s extensive catalog of vegetative wonders is the dolina ring seed, samples of which are held by several universities and agribusiness concerns throughout the galaxy. Although the samples’ provenance is now unknown, their unusual shape and mysterious properties continue to be studied by scientists.
[P]The seeds are just that, embryonic plants forming both the culmination and the beginning of the life cycle of an unknown angiosperm. However, unlike the vast majority of coated seeds that have been cataloged from across known space, dolina ring seeds are not spherical or ovoid. Instead, the hardened fruit layer, or endocarp, surrounding and fused to the actual seed material takes the form of a woody ring about three centimeters in diameter. This unique shape has long fascinated biologists, who seek to learn what form of plant might grow from a ring. However, no dolina ring seeds have ever germinated away from the soggy soils of Dagobah, so no one now living knows what manner of shrub, flowering plant, or tree might grow from them.
[P]Normally, thus stymied, scientists would turn their attention to some other wonder, but the dolina ring seeds have characteristics that make them fascinating on their own. For one thing, they are near-indestructible, capable of withstanding tremendous pressures, extremes of temperature, and baths of caustic and corrosive chemicals with little or no physical evidence of trauma to their outer coatings. Another property unusual in a clearly biological artifact is the seeds' extraordinary density. Though small enough to be held in the palm of a human’s hand, and even of a size and shape appropriate to be worn as jewelry on some sentients’ fingers, dolina ring seeds mass in at an incredible nine kilograms on average, making them some of the heaviest known plant matter.
[P]There is another characteristic of dolina ring seeds, known to only the very few Force-sensitive scientists who have studied them, kept as a closely guarded secret. Their Force reactivity was first discovered and described by a Sullustan agronomist in the employ of a Mid Rim foodstuffs company just a few years after the end of the Clone Wars. All of this scientist’s research, and the scientist herself, were promptly confiscated by agents of the Empire. Around the same time, a human farmer and chemist working independently came across a dolina ring seed in a lot of seed stocks he had purchased as part of a load of salvage from a Trandoshan junk dealer. Unaware of the scant findings that had been published about the ring seeds, this man at first kept the sample as a simple curiosity. It was only when an Imperial sweep of his planet for Force sensitives targeted his young daughter that the ring’s value became apparent.
[P]Seeking to protect his daughter from Inquisitorial kidnapping, the farmer hid her in his laboratory while he tried to convince the Imperial agents that she was offworld with her mother. A quick records check showed the agents that the farmer was in fact a widower, and then the casual brutality of the Empire evinced itself as they shot the man in cold blood. Overhearing the execution, the girl cast about desperately for anything that might save her, and it was then that the innate Force abilities that had attracted the attention of the Inquisition in the first place reacted with the dolina ring seed. Sensing that she should do so, and ignoring its incredible weight, the girl slipped the seed onto her thumb. The energy of the Living Force filled her body, taking the form of an incredible burst of speed. The Imperial agents saw only a blur as she fled into the night, never to be seen by them again.
[P]Now a grown woman, Syla Trasker is an accomplished Force adept and a member of the Rebellion. She still wears the dolina ring seed her father found, now on a chain around her neck, its weight unfelt and thus no hindrance. It gives her the ability to run at tremendous Force-granted speeds, though such efforts are only sustainable for a short time and are exhausting. Tests performed by Syla and Rebellion scientists show that both the variable weight and the speedgranting properties of the seed are only active when it is held by a Force-sensitive being.
[P]A Force-sensitive character who possesses a dolina ring seed may perform one free Move maneuver during each of his turns. This Move maneuver may be in addition to any other maneuvers performed this turn and can allow the character to perform three maneuvers in a turn. (The user also ignores the ring seed’s weight.)

      [H3]Dram of Orphne[h3]
The curious Mid Rim planet of Aleen has long been speculated to be a place with a strong natural resonance with the Force. Unusual (some would say impossible) features of the planet’s ecology, topology, and atmosphere lend credence to theories that the Force saturates the very crust of the planet, and the existence of the artifact known as the Dram of Orphne adds further support.
[P]The bifurcated world of Aleen is divided into the surface world, populated by the gregarious and relatively well-known Aleena people, and a mysterious Underworld, ruled by the towering, treelike Kindalo. The division between the two peoples and their environments is absolute. For centuries, it was thought that only the world’s massive arbozoic trees could be said to cross the boundary between the two worlds of Aleen. But during the Clone Wars, a creature out of legend revealed itself. Members of a Republic relief force encountered an Underworld being known as Orphne—neither Aleena nor Kindalo, but of some other, unknown species—a sylphlike being who spoke in riddles.
[P]When those Republic personnel found themselves trapped in the Underworld, they only escaped when they managed to puzzle out the answer to a conundrum posed in verse by Orphne. Critical to their escape was their physical location. By solving the riddle, they moved within what has come to be known as Orphne’s Fountain, a sophisticated device based on either unknown technology or on the Force itself. Orphne’s Fountain transported the trapped Republic personnel from the Underworld to the surface on a massive jet of water. A phenomenon practically unknown on the relatively arid planet, this unexpected event is well remembered by the Aleena.
[P]According to official Republic records, what happened next was relatively straightforward. A breach between Aleen’s surface and subterranean worlds was sealed, ending the groundquakes that had necessitated the Republic relief effort in the first place. However, unknown to the commanders of the clone forces on the planet, agents of then-Chancellor Palpatine had been secreted among the medical and support staff sent to their division. One of these agents, acting on standing orders to record any unusual phenomena possibly related to the Force, collected a sample of the water of Orphne’s Fountain. The agent planned to smuggle the sample offworld to Coruscant.
[P]Why what has become known as the Dram of Orphne never made it off Aleen is unclear. It is possible that the agent was discovered and countered (or even eliminated) by either the Aleena or even the Kindalo, perhaps acting at the behest of Orphne. The vial is currently held by Aleena mystics, who have enshrined it at the center of one of the colossal statues they tend. The Aleena, unlike the Kindalo, are not known to have ever had direct contact with Orphne, but they nevertheless hold the Dram sacred, using it as a focus of unusually efficacious healing rituals.
[P]A Force-sensitive character who possesses the Dram of Orphne heals 1 additional strain at the end of an encounter. A Force-sensitive character who possesses the Dram of Orphne also heals 1 additional wound when benefiting from natural rest. Finally, when making a Medicine check to heal another character, any character with the Dram of Orphne may add [BO] to the check.

      [H3]Eyes of Laqasa[h3]
The Jedi Knight Laqasa Trill was a Devaronian woman and an incredibly skilled hunter, excelling at an activity more often practiced by Devaronian men. Trill was an exemplar of the philosophy of hunting that ecologists promote, carefully choosing her marks from overpopulated game species or stalking the rare rogue predators that target sapients. She insisted that hunting was a meditative act, and she claimed to owe her phenomenal success to the Force-enabled connection she shared with her quarry.
[P]Although she was an accomplished Jedi, Trill was careful never to use the order’s signature weapon, her lightsaber, in the hunt. Instead, she adopted the tools and weapons of the local hunters in whatever environment she found herself, thus mastering a dizzying array of techniques and technologies. She was not above modifying the accoutrements she came across in her travels, however, and at least one example of her tinkering is thought to have survived to the present day. Rumored to be stored in a hunting lodge deep in Devaron’s Blue Mountains, the Force-imbued goggles known as the Eyes of Laqasa miniaturize the functions of high-end electrobinoculars within a pair of crystalline lenses set into a leather headband. It is those crystal lenses, and the powers the Jedi invested in them, that mark the Eyes of Laqasa as a powerful Force artifact.
[P]The particular impetus for the invention of the Eyes of Laqasa is a Devaronian legend. Late in Laqasa Trill’s life, a male hunter secretly and illegally imported a troop of large predators that shared the characteristics of simians and reptiles. Their world of origin is unknown to this day, but what made the animals unique, even more than their viciousness, was their Force-enabled chameleon ability, a trait that had evolved in the beasts to such an extent that they were practically invisible in natural surroundings. The hunter released the troop into a supposedly enclosed hunting sanctuary, which they promptly escaped after slaying their would-be killer and his game wardens.
[P]For the next two years, the troop wreaked havoc on the ecosystem of Devaron’s northern continent, ranging far and wide and eluding the finest hunters on the planet. It was then that Laqasa Trill arrived, making one of her infrequent visits to her homeworld. When she learned of the situation, she vowed to end the threat posed by the alien predators once and for all. Taking only what she could carry on her back, the idiosyncratic huntress disappeared into the wilderness.
[P]The Jedi was never known to take trophies except for this instance. When she returned to civilization over a year later, she wore an ankle-length, color-shifting cloak woven from the hides of her prey. She also wore a set of goggles she had constructed in the course of her hunt, and she recorded in her journals that she owed not only her success to the Eyes, but her very life.
[P]When wearing the Eyes of Laqasa, Force-sensitive characters remove all [SE] imposed due to darkness, concealment, camouflage, or similar effects, and can see normally as if in normal daylight.

      [H3]Grimoire of Syclos the Lame[h3]
Whereas most citizens of other planets may believe the Force to be but a legend, on the Wild Space planet of Weik, the Force is known to exist without a doubt. Equally feared and celebrated, it is utilized by many of the world’s residents on a daily basis. It is not, however, understood in the manner propagated by the Jedi, or even the Sith. Instead, on Weik, the Force is viewed as magic.
[P]Over the centuries since the unique culture of Weik arose in the wake of a crash landing, all the trappings and mysteries associated with fantasy holodramas and children’s tales have found real-world analogs on the planet. Ignorant of how the wider galaxy sees such things, the people of Weik are familiar with what they consider to be “magical’’ weapons and armor, ensorcelled objects of power ranging from clothing to tools, and even, as in the case of the legendary Grimoire of Syclos the Lame, spellbooks.
[P]Befitting its portentous name, the Grimoire is a large, leather-bound book, its cover tooled with mystic patterns, reinforced with bronze bosses, and liberally decorated with darkly sparkling gemstones. Central to the cover design is a glyph of power that only offplanet observers might recognize as a stylized, winged lightsaber. Of greater interest to most students of the Force, however, is the book’s contents.
[P]Hand sewn into a cloth binding, some eight dozen gathers of parchment form 386 closely lined pages. The source of the parchment is a minor mystery among the many that surround the Grimoire. Though the Grimoire was clearly prepared in the manner traditional on Weik—from animal skins flayed, soaked, and stretched on frames—the green-gray color of its pages suggests that the skins used were not those of any animal known to the planet. Neither is the luminous ink used in scribing the pages of a formula replicated in any other known Weik-produced book, whether “magical” or not.
[P]The effect of the glowing amber ink against the background of gray and green would have offered a challenging reading experience even if Syclos the Lame—if she was in fact the scribe—had been an accomplished calligrapher. Unfortunately, whoever penned what have been called the book’s “mad ravings” was far more concerned with utilizing every square centimeter of available space than with legibility. It has been estimated that the Grimoire of Syclos the Lame contains more than a half-million individual words, whereas books of similar provenance and size usually contain around two hundred thousand, even when they are not so liberally embellished as the Grimoire.
[P]It is those embellishments—or rather, their many reproductions—that have given this tome its fame on Weik. Taking the form of creatures out of nightmare, the capital letters heading each page are hollow-eyed, many-limbed monsters, rendered in glowing ink that seems to cause them to move on the page. No figure is repeated across the Grimoire’s pages, yielding a fiendish menagerie of beasts that would give pause even to far-traveled big game hunters of the wider galaxy. The Beasts of Syclos, as they are popularly known, may be found copied in many other volumes, and they have even been rendered in stone as rain-spouting gargoyles on Weik’s cathedrals and castles. Large mock versions of the creatures crafted from paper and daub are carried aloft on wooden poles through Weik’s villages. This occurs at sunset on the autumnal equinox, in a celebration known as the Feast of Worms.
[P]But for all its local fame, the Grimoire has been little studied by the sages of Weik. The peculiarities of its production and the nigh-indecipherable scrawl of its scribing would be daunting enough, but Weik is a place where legends are given great credence, and according to legend, to read the
words of Syclos the Lame is to invite madness. The secrets it unlocks are said to be sorely tempting for the power they offer, but the ultimate promise of the lame wizard’s teachings is death. The Grimoire’s information is said to be applicable to beasts across the galaxy, not just those located on Weik.
[P]Studying the Grimoire of Syclos the Lame for at least one hour allows a Force-sensitive character to add [FO] to all Force power checks or checks involving Force talents when dealing with creatures detailed in the Grimoire. The bonus lasts until the end of the game session. (What creatures the bonus applies to is ultimately up to the GM, as some creatures may not be covered in the Grimoire.)
[P]However, until the end of the game session, the difficulty of all fear checks made while confronting these creatures is upgraded twice. Any Conflict generated by a [DE]  result on a fear check is doubled.

      [H3]Herder's Gauntlet[h3]
The Iktotchi people are blessed with the talents of precognition, an ability found to benefit from augmentation by the Force when their world was incorporated into the Republic thousands of years ago. Though their natural talent for foretelling the future fades exponentially the farther they travel from their home moon, Iktotchi Force sensitives, particularly among the Jedi, formulated many techniques to expand and refine their native precognitive abilities using the Force.
[P]One common Force power that did not come naturally to the Iktotchi, however, was the ability to move objects at a distance. Their native precognition, in other words, did not translate automatically into skill with the Force ability that mimics telekinesis. Though Iktotchi Jedi more than made up for this with their mastery of other Force talents, the Jedi Master Needa Kame saw an opportunity in the seeming shortcoming.
[P]Around 900 BBY, Needa Kame took a leave of absence from his Jedi duties and traveled to Iktotch for an extended period of meditation and study. He built a retreat in the mountains of that windswept moon, and devoted over a decade to developing the Force-imbued Gauntlet that bears his name. Exquisitely crafted from the hide and horns of a sure-footed ungulate native to the Iktotchi highlands, the Herder’s Gauntlet is, unsurprisingly, fitted for an Iktotchi, with larger fingers and a broader palm than a human’s.
[P]During his years of working on the Gauntlet, Master Kame was not completely isolated. The inhabitants of the village closest to his simple dwelling frequently made the half-day trek to visit the Jedi, bringing him food and other supplies in exchange for advice, or out of simple neighborliness. Over time, the children of the village transitioned from fearing the strange old man to adopting him as a sort of eccentric grandfather. Needa Kame did not discourage this, being possessed of both a gentle soul and a sparkling sense of humor.
[P]It was this latter quality that eventually led to the breakthrough that allowed the completion of the Herder’s Gauntlet. Through years of experimentation and tinkering, Master Kame had come frustratingly close to realizing his ambition of creating an aid for Iktotchi Force users unskilled at telekinesis time and time again, only to have some obstacle or oversight see him fall short. It was when the village children were visiting him on one occasion that the Jedi, wearing the Gauntlet because he had been working on it when they arrived, decided to amuse his guests with some legerdemain, showing off some perfectly mundane sleight-of-hand tricks he had learned at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant in his student days. But Needa Kame fumbled the trick he was performing (pulling a local fruit from behind a small girl’s ear), earning good hearted jeers from the children. At that moment, the Jedi experienced a revelation, realizing that his Gauntlet was as advanced as it ever need be. Instead, it was his application of the Force that had been wanting. Readdressing the problem, he centered himself, held out his gauntleted hand, and lifted the delighted little girl into the air.
[P]A Force-sensitive character who wears the Herder’s Gauntlet counts as possessing the Move basic power, and may make a Move Force power action as a maneuver. A character who does so may not attack an opponent with this use of the Force power (what constitutes an attack is ultimately up to the GM, but should include disarming or incapacitating opponents as well as dealing damage).

    <Name>Taradon's Helm</Name>
    <Description>
      [H3]Taradon's Helm[h3]
Somewhere in the icy wastes of Hum, the wreckage of a starfighter serves as the tomb of the Jedi Taradon, a Corellian human possessed of extraordinary prowess as a pilot. Taradon was a member of the Jedi Order in the early days of the Republic. If legends are to be believed, he pursued evildoers with blade and blaster for almost a century before disappearing while fighting off a raid of the Jedi-protected planet Hum.
[P]Taradon is known to have brought dozens of galactic criminals to justice, but unlike other famous Jedi Knights, he rarely met his foes face to face. Instead, he haunted the spacelanes, ghosting in and out of hyperspace at the controls of one of the half-dozen starfighters and gunboats he is known to have piloted. Whether acting on his own or at the behest of the Jedi Council, the human always preferred to stalk his prey while safely ensconced in a cockpit, where his preternatural skills and technical acumen eventually led him to develop the omnicompatible piloting device known today as Taradon’s Helm.
[P]Though many shipwrights and pilots have heard tales of the Helm, few could venture to describe its physical characteristics, much less its functions. The Helm is known to have been human-portable; hot-swappable into the hardware of dozens, if not hundreds, of different ship types; and capable of integrating piloting, navigation, and weapon systems into a discrete, maddeningly complicated interface. What is less well known is that Taradon imbued his unique invention with secret crystalline technologies that tap into the Force, enabling those who use it to channel their courage and wisdom into extraordinary acts of piloting derring-do.
[P]In fact, the device now called the Helm (it is unknown by what name Taradon referred to it) is relatively small and bears more resemblance to a modern slicer’s gear than to surviving examples of early Republic starship control mechanisms. It takes the form of a control box studded with switches, buttons, and indicator lights, roughly rectangular but tapering to a conical point on one side. This cone, along with the leads that extend from it, is the interface point that connects Taradon’s Helm to the controls of almost any craft capable of flight, from simple atmospheric hoppers to interstellar dreadnoughts. The design is wickedly clever, with multiple methods available to connect the Helm to a ship, accounting for the mind-boggling array of craft it could augment.
[P]Reinforced and rugged, the Helm is believed to have survived the crash that took Taradon’s life on Hum. It may be seen as ironic that this ace of the spacelanes and ship’s captain without peer died in a crash, but, in fact, other survivors of the battle in the planet’s frigid skies believed that Taradon of Corellia sacrificed himself in a successful last-ditch effort to fight off a force led by turncoat Jedi raiding for kyber crystals.
[P]Taradon was flying in close action against a starfighter piloted by a rogue Jedi when they entered orbit around Hum. The traitor pilot was a Rodian Jedi turned assassin named Deelguh, whom Taradon had trained with as a young Padawan. Taradon had long sought to bring Deelguh to justice, only to be stymied time and again, as the Rodian was his near-equal as a pilot. Knowing that the fearsome fighter would become yet more dangerous if the raiding mission succeeded, Taradon knew the raid must be stopped. With Deelguh’s ship about to land, having successfully fought off Taradon’s attacks, the Corellian apparently chose to bring both vessels down in a fiery collision. Presumably unable to eject or unwilling to leave his ship behind, Taradon rode his burning craft all the way down to the surface, to his death. He died secure in the knowledge that Deelguh had also met his end.
[P]Expeditions to investigate the crash site were never successful in locating the wrecked ship, but a careful examination of Taradon’s transmitted flight logs revealed an unidentifiable surge of energy coming from the Corellian’s navicomputer moments before his death. The Jedi who reviewed the logs theorized that it might have been a function of the legendary Taradon’s Helm, fighting to protect its master, a conclusion scoffed at by others, who said the Helm would never have disobeyed a command.
[P]A Force-sensitive character who possesses Taradon’s Helm may reroll one [FORCE] when making checks that involve piloting or using a starship or vehicle. If there is some question as to whether the check involves piloting or using a starship or vehicle, the CM is the final arbiter.</Description>

      [H3]Tear of the Elders[h3]
Before humans ever came to Naboo, another starfaring species discovered the Gungans in Naboo’s swamps and seas. Little is known about these so-called “Elders” beyond what can be gleaned from the statuary they left behind on the planet and on Rori, one of the planet’s three moons. The Elders, it is theorized, were humanlike in appearance, though even that conjecture is only tenable if the enormous faces of their monuments are held to be representative of the Elders themselves, which is far from certain. Another theory, based on certain features of the faces, holds that the Elders were Force users. This would seem even more tenuous than other beliefs concerning their physiology, were it not for the existence of a Force artifact known as the Tear of the Elders.
[P]Long treasured by the Gungans, the Tear of the Elders is a fist-sized piece of granitic rock, shaped, as its name suggests, in a teardrop formation. Teams of Gungan geologists and artisans who analyzed the Tear uncovered three crucial facts. First, it is formed of the same substance the Elders used in their statues, a rock matrix native to Naboo and its moons. Second, none of the hundreds of known examples of Elder statuary depict tears. Finally, unlike the monumental statues, the Tear has no toolmarks of any kind. These facts, along with the Tear’s shape, would suggest that it is an unlikely, but not impossible, naturally occurring stone form, were it not for the widely known legend about it.
[P]According to this legend (Gungan scholars insist that it is historical truth, though they can offer no documentary evidence supporting their claim), sometime in the long years between the departure of the Elders and the first visits to Naboo by humans, the Gungan people adopted the relics of the Elders into their religion in practices that continue to this day. The isolated monuments of the Elders are considered holy sites, and they are venerated as places of great power. It was at one of these sites—the Gungans do not say which, specifically—that the event they call “Tearfall” occurred.
[P]Force sensitivity is neither rarer nor more frequent among the Gungans than the galactic average, so it is no surprise that before the rise of the Republic and the founding of the Jedi Order, some few Gungans evinced powers that would now be recognized as Force-based. One such Gungan, his name lost to history, was the resident guardian of an Elder statue. In the course of his meditations, this Gungan cast his awareness out into the world, eventually becoming so skilled that he could sense events over the whole surface of Naboo, and even beyond. On the day he sat before the Elder statue and sensed the first human scout ships entering orbit, a great and unaccountable grief overcame the Gungan mystic. When he looked up, he saw a gray tear impossibly welling up in the stone face he sat before. Holding out his hand, he caught the Tear of the Elders in his hand as it fell.</Description>

      [H3]Tool Kit[h3]

In a technological galaxy, a tool kit is almost essential. Every vessel, no matter the size or function, has some sort of repair kit to deal with mechanical or electric failures, as calling for assistance is often not practical (or safe). Kits are also useful for repairing damaged droids or cybernetic parts, especially ones too modified to take to reputable mechanics. Tool kits need to have a wide range of gear, as many users are fond of tinkering and upgrading on their own. Basic hammers, hydrospanner wrenches, restraining bolts, power coupling scrubbers, fusion cutters, laser and sonic welders, replacement wiring and components, power calibrators, and of course welding goggles and heavy gloves are all standard components. Many of these also make for effective improvised weapons. For those used to doing extensive repairs, some kits include diagnostic probes and other aids to determine the nature of the fault. There is little a skilled mechanic cannot fix with a well-maintained and well-stocked toolkit, given adequate time to conduct the repairs (which is sometimes a problem too).

[P]Toolkits allow mechanics to perform most Mechanics checks to repair mechanical devices, and can also be used to "heal" droids.

When worn, the user's vision is subsequently enhanced, including thermal imaging as well as improved vision under minimal light conditions.
[P]Tracker's goggles grant [BO] to the wearer's Perception skill checks to locate a target by sight. Additionally, tracker's goggles remove [SE][SE] imposed due to concealment, darkness, or fog and mist from the wearer's Ranged (Light) and Ranged (Heavy) Combat skill checks.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]Training Weights[h3]
Many Warriors wear weighted bracers or anklets when training. This added weight and resistance not only helps the Warrior to build muscle, but also better prepares them to fight in difficult circumstances such as high-gravity environments. High-end models may incorporate an onboard computer that tracks the user's activity and even sets fitness goals. Some Warriors wear training weights in decidedly real-and potentially lethal-combat situations, although this contradicts all manufacturer specifications.
[P]A character wearing one or more training weights adds [SE] to all Brawn- and Agility-based checks, and to all combat checks. If a character wears training weights throughout a game session, increase the amount of XP the character receives for the session by 1. At the GM's discretion, a character wearing training weights may not receive this additional XP if they did not make any checks affected by the weights during the session.

[P] The vast majority of known galactic species speak or understand Basic, Explorers who work with less civilized or cosmopolitan species, however, may have to engage with individuals who converse in a lesser-known tongue. In most cases, a protocol droid presents a convenient solution-capable of addressing not only language but also etiquette concerns. If an appropriate droid is unavailable, individuals need to use other tools. A transliterator offers a more portable solution. Far more compact than a droid, this device can also be useful in situations where more discretion is required. Further, a transliterator detects colloquial implications of phrases, based upon input cultures. This can enable the user to recognize more subtle points of discussion. It is also helpful when reviewing media in a different dialect, for explaining and clarifying local experessions.

Initially designed by the Vacutech Combine—which ran out of capital and declared bankruptcy during the development of this weapon thanks to Imperial meddling—the Vac Attack is a small projectile launcher worn around the wrist like a chrono. It fires bursts of small, extremely sharp discs that can shred armor and flesh like a flechette. The weapon's spread can be adjusted so that it fires all of its discs in a single line or in a broad arc that can catch multiple targets. Entirely silent and easily concealable, the Mk-127 is often used for jobs in which silence and stealth are paramount.
[P]Changing the weapon's spread from single to arc requires a maneuver and grants the weapon the Blast 6 item quality. If Blast is activated, the weapon's supply of discs is exhausted in the shot. When worn on both wrists, Mk-127s can be fired as if they were a single weapon with a regular combat check, gaining the Linked 2 quality. Noticing that an individual is wearing one or a pair of these weapons requires a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b]. At the Game Master's discretion, the discs can be coated with various toxins. Reloads for the Mk-127 contain four discs and cost 100 credits.</Description>

[P]Designed and distributed by Saldalith Manufacturing, the Verdicator is billed as a personal lie-detection device. The user of the device cnan discreetly monitor changes in the physiological functions of a specified target nearby. It tracks metrics that include pulse, blood pressure, rate of respiration, eye activity and body temperature. Such changes are convered to the user by a series of discret pressure nodes that pulsate against the wearer's skin.
[P]Veridicators are most often disguised as pieces of jewelry, such as bracelets or pendants, inset with a tasteful Falasian liquid crystal. The crystal is actually the Veridicatiors receptor, and it can only monitor targets within a sixty-degree scanning arc. Popular with security forces and corporate recruiters during interviews, the Veridicator has also been used by undercover operatves on both sides of the galactic rebellion. Though useful under the proper circumstances, the devices are only as effective as the individuals  who employ them. Only one target can be scanned and monitored at a time, and they must be relatively nearby. Both the user and the target must remain relatively still, though small movements are unlikely to affect the device's readings.
[P]A character wearing a Veridicator 200 adds [BO][BO] to checks to discern whether another character is lying or omitting significant informaiton, and adds [BO][BO] to checks to ascertain another character's mental state.      </Description>

They are composed of a thin, flexible material that resembles the carahide exoskeleton of a Verpine, which extends from the top of the hands to the elbow. When an electric current is passed through the gauntlets, the material grows exceptionally rigid and supportive.
[P]Due to this additional stability, Verpine bond gauntlets grant their users a [BO] to checks made to handle volatile materials or perform delicate work. Such circumstances should be adjudicated by the CM on a case-by-case basis, and may include Computers and Mechanics checks to make delicate repairs and Skulduggery checks to pick locks or disable traps.</Description>

[P]The mode of short-wave telecommunication used by the Verpine is undetectable outside their species. The Rebel Alliance has, through trial and error, devised a type of comlink that is specially tuned to the Verpine frequency. With such a comlink, Verpine communications can be intercepted, and direct communication with the Verpine can be established within a range of 100 kilometers.
[P]Interestingly, the signals received on a Verpine comlink when in close proximity to one of their colonies often consist of garbled-sounding transmissions that are, in fact, the product of every Verpine in the colony “speaking” at the same time. Such comlinks are much more effective when used in conjunction with a small group of Verpine away from a large colony.
[P]That said, Verpine also have some control over the frequencies in which they can broadcast, similar to the way humans can modulate the tones of their own voices. This allows Verpine to choose different “channels,” which the comlink can then be tuned to, allowing for discreet communication even in the midst of the largest Verpine colonies.</Description>

Data is transmitted to and from the vessel implant by way of a fiber-optic cable that can connect to nearly any datapad or computer. Extremely small and unobtrusive, they are typically set into the back of a user's skull and hidden by hair or a flap of synthetic skin.
[P]They are highly secure, non-networked, and equipped with a stout anti-virus package. They cannot be sliced unless the user is incapacitated or the implant is removed. The user cannot access the information contained in the implant, so unless that person uploaded the data personally he typically does not know what information is within the item. Most agents who use this device prefer this arrangement as it helps ensure they cannot possibly divulge the secrets they carry.

Vid-vox scramblers are small personal signal-jamming generators prized by intelligence agents, corporate officers, military brass, powerful crime bosses, and anyone else interested in keeping their private conversations private. When activated, a vid-vox scrambler generates a low-intensity comms-jamming field that disrupts all audio, video, and holographic recording within its area of effect while leaving conversation unaffected.

A [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b] can be made to attempt to overhear a pertinent part of the conversation from within the jamming bubble. Using a recording device to listen in requires a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Computers check[b]; even if the check is successful, any information recorded is incomplete and spotty at best. Recording devices used outside the area of effect cannot detect anything at all.</Description>

In the tumbling of dice and the randomness of fate, some Mystics may catch glimpses of the future. Generally a pair of six-sided dice, Vision Cubes are not all that different from Chance Cubes. Vision Cubes tend to have intricate scenes painted on their faces. They first rose to prominence as part of a high-stakes dice game which was since eclipsed by sabacc. The breathtaking art on these dice lends itself well to the act of divination. Whether these visions are mere trickery or true feats of clairvoyance depends on the owner.
[P]A character can use a vision cube while performing a check (including a Force power check) to divine the future. If the check results in having at least one uncanceled [AD], the character adds [SU] and [LI] to the results as well. If the check results in having at least one uncanceled [TH], the character instead adds [FA] and [DA] to the results. If the check has no [TH] or [AD] results, the vision cubes do nothing-except potentially look impressive.</Description>

Life on Sembla owes a great deal to the planet's many active volcanoes. The intense geothermal energy of the planet warms the world's shallow seas. The seas, in turn, host a cavalcade of life. Lava flows bring minerals and materials to the surface. While they never developed heavy industry, the Vurk are famous for their craftsmanship. The vast majority of art produced on Sembla depicts the volcanoes. At times, this reverence has bordered on religious devotion.
[P]One of the oldest tokens of this reverence is the Vurk Meditation
Orb. The orbs are perfect obsidian spheres, roughly 15 centimeters across. Part of the consecration process involves polishing the surface to a mirror sheen. Even though the Vurk invest a lot of time into crafting them, they do not consider them manufactured. From the traditional standpoint, they are not made so much as found. Any spherical chunk of obsidian can serve the orb's function. While the most sacred orbs are perfectly black, sages tolerate-even prefer-the presence of impurities within the glass.
[P]Studying the opaque sphere allows a Mystic to focus inwards, leaving the world behind. In this state, they see only the connections between beings, hear only the whispers of the Force. This meditation lasts for at least an hour, and for the 24 hours following this meditation, they may suffer 2 strain to add [FP] to the results of the next check to use the Alter or Battle Meditation Force power.</Description>

Vutalamine is a common anti-anxiety drug that BioTech Industries produces and sells throughout the galaxy. Colloquially known as "vue," it has been a mainstay of the galactic pharmacopeia for treating psychological maladies, muscle spasms, and seizures for at least a century. Vue has a calming effect that allows individuals to process information more clearly and make better decisions. It also slows down breathing and circulation, along with reducing tremors and steadying limbs. Thanks to these last qualities, many sharpshooters, slicers, and assassins use the drug to help steady their hands while shooting or to steady their nerves in extremely stressful situations. Long-term use of vue can be addicting, and side effects can include acute paranoia, suicidal ideation, and impairment of memory and judgement.
[P]A single dose of vue lasts for twenty-four hours. During that time, the character upgrades the ability of any checks made to resist stress or fear once. In addition, the difficulty of Ranged (Light) and Ranged (Heavy) checks made at long or extreme range is reduced by one. At the Game Master's discretion, frequent use of vue can cause impaired judgement and loss of memory, imposing permanent [SE] on Intellect- and Cunning-based checks.</Description>

      [H3]GX-8 Water Vaporator[h3]

The most popular and well regarded moisture vaporator on the galactic market, Pretormin Environmental's GX-8 has provided fresh, safe water to planetary pioneers for generations. These delicate looking, spindly constructs consist of a five meter tall tower containing a low-powered ion generator and a powerful cooling system. The GX-8 rapidly cools the air around it, causing heavy condensation that is collected and purified by the systems at the vaporator's base. Once conditioned, the fresh water is typically collected in subterranean holding tanks for use in private, public, commercial, and industrial applications. Typically used on hot, arid worlds such as Tatooine, vaporators are organized in sprawling farms, or "water orchards," where their combined condensing and filtration systems can provide a steady supply of water for a settlement. A curious side effect of the use of moisture vaporators is the growth of lush native plants and fungi that tend to spring up in the constantly irrigated ground directly surrounding the machine. These small rings, referred to as "vaporator gardens," are good places to collect edible plants.

[P]Depending on the moisture levels in the air, a vaporator can typically produce one to three liters of water in a standard day.</Description>

For example, a kit for blasters might contain a small, basic precision toolkit, a circuit tester, galven pattern repair jig, fusion solder, cleaning solutions, extra lenses, and spare cylinder of Tibanna gas. These tools are usually carried in a small roll or case to keep them together and organized.

[P]In the days of the former Republic and the Jedi Order, the WJ-880 blinding helmet was a common training aid for a Jedi Padawan, helping the aspirant to learn to sense the Force flowing through all things by cutting out sensory distractions. The helmet's opaque shield prevents the wearers from relying on sight: instead, they must use their instincts. Of course, these devices are not particularly practical for combat, but they can be exceptionally useful to anyone trying to train in the ways of the Force. As artifacts of the Jedi Order, these devices are contraband, but they are hardly so obvious as a lightsaber, and so a number of them have passed into civilian hands. Force sensitives in this era can acquire them with far less difficulty than most Jedi relics, or they can even make their own facsimilies using basic supplies.
[P]A character wearing a WJ-880 blinding helmet adds [SE][SE][SE] to Combat checks (and any other checks that rely on sight). At the GM's discretion, training while wearing such a helmet might help a character to develop his perception of the Force that shapes and guides the universe around him.     </Description>

Produced by the Verpine Chiles-Zraii consortium, the Foreman-series of owner's workshop manuals are a must-have for anyone responsible for the care and maintenance of a ship, walker, speeder, or groundcar. Written for an exhaustive array of ships and vehicles, from the Flare-S Swoop to the YT-1300 to the gravity control system of an Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, each owner's workshop manual features detailed, clearly written, and illustrated instructions designed to assist even an inexperienced mechanic in maintaining or repairing a vehicle, vessel, or a specific system described therein. The manuals are sold in single-use, read-only datapads that contain all the information needed to make repairs, and feature expandable, three-dimensional parts diagrams with constantly updated parts numbers and a wireless connection to the galactic holonet. They also include a diagnostic program that assists in maintenance and repair by using the vehicle's onboard computer to trace circuits and find faults within systems. This allows a mechanic to diagnose the problem with his machine, see what parts he needs, order those parts from the nearest supplier, and then gives him all the information needed to install the parts and fix his problem.

[P]Using an owner's workshop manual allows the character to downgrade the difficulty of any checks made to maintain or repair the vehicle or starship for which the manual was written once. Owner's manuals give no bonuses to work on other vehicles for which they are not written. For example, an owner's workshop manual for the YT-1300 grants bonuses when working on a YT-1300, but not when working on a Y-wing. At the Game Master's discretion, a workshop manual can be used on two ships or vehicles from the same company with a high parts commonality, such as CEC YT-series freighters. The rarity of a workshop manual is equal to the rarity of the starship or vehicle for which it was written.</Description>

      [H3]XV-09 Chemical Restraint Harness[h3]

The XV-09 Pacifier is one of the more uncommon products sold by Xenovet. Roundly derided by those who make their living with animals as a cheap shortcut used by quacks and animal haters, the Pacifier is designed to control a wild or otherwise uncontrollable animal through chems rather than training. Similar to a typical riding or restraining harness, the Pacifier is made of a sturdy and flexible synthetic weave that loops around a creature's ribs, chest, and shoulders with a heavy brace that sits at its withers. Built into the back brace is a refillable auto-hypo typically filled with a cocktail of behavior-controlling drugs. The auto-hypo is connected to a remote that can trigger the pump at up to close range, and is used in much the same way as a remote for a droid restraining bolt. While the drugs tend to make even the most cross-grained creature docile and biddable, they can also have a number of unforeseen side effects ranging from dulling a creature's intellect or senses to killing it with an overdose.

[P]Using a Pacifier on a wild animal is a temporary fix at best, and should only be done in emergencies. Mounting the harness on a creature requires a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Survival check[b] to ensure the harness is fitted properly and the auto-hypo is situated correctly. The difficulty of this check can be reduced by 1 with a successful [B]Knowledge (Xenology) check[b]. If successful, the XV-09 grants [BO][BO] to any Survival checks made to control the beast wearing the harness. In addition, creatures that are successfully pacified gain [BO] to any Discipline checks. Game Masters can spend any [TH] generated by the initial Survival check to reflect one or more negative side effects caused by the drugs. The exact nature of these side effects is left to the Game Master's discretion. In addition, the Game Master can spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] to reflect a catastrophic reaction to the drugs, such as a heart attack or brain aneurysm, which results in the animal's death. While safe for use on animals, the powerful mixture of chemicals in the harness can be dangerous to the minds of sentient beings. Attaching the harness to a sentient being can result in permanent brain damage and even death. </Description>

Designed for use by veterinarians, beast breeders, or anyone who deals with large and often dangerous animals for a living, the PLAV features a veterinary clinic's worth of equipment in an easy to carry, man-portable package. Roughly the size of a large duffel, within its lockable, hard-sided case the PLAV contains enough drugs, medical supplies, specialty tools, and other gear to stabilize wounded creatures in the field until they can be moved to a fully outfitted clinic. The kit also contains a datapad containing a specialized knowledge and emergency procedure database for many of the more well-known beasts, as well as tutorials to assist those with no veterinary training in treating wounded creatures in an emergency.

[P]The PLAV allow a user to examine, analyze, and perform medical procedures on all manner of creatures. Like the medpac does for humanoid species (see page 192 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook), the PLAV allow a character to medically treat alien creatures without penalty as per the rules on page 232. Additionally, it grants [BO] to all Medicine, Survival, and Knowledge (Xenology) skill checks made to analyze or treat these creatures.</Description>

      [H3]Yaladai Spice[h3]
Yaladai spice is a prized and expensive stimulant, worth many times the value of more common drugs, such as glitterstim, on the black market. To most, it offers a supreme clarity of thought and focus, along with a sense of relaxation that refreshes the user even through extended activity. The spice is extremely addictive with long-term use, but those who can afford to take it regularly it regularly rarely stop for this reason. The benefits of yaladai spice express themselves most strongly among Force users, who can use it to temporarily enhance their abilities and connection to the Force. This can be a double-edge sword as the enhanced connection usually amplifies any negative emotions or effects to which the user experiences.
[P]Yaladai spice has effects that last for one encounter. When a character under the effects of the spice suffers strain, whe suffers three less strain, to a minimum of one. This does not apply to voluntary strain loss. Additionally, a Force user under the effects of yaladai spice can add [FO] to any Force power checks she makes. When she does so, however, the spice doubles any strain and Conflict suffered for using {DA] to generate [FP].</Description>

      [H3]Yarrock[h3]

For untold ages, the spice called yarrock has been produced on Iridonia, created by their shamans to grant their warriors a greater clarity of mind and violent purpose. Though there are other drugs that fit this description scattered across the galaxy, many seasoned warriors respond with respect, adulation, or even fear to the mere sight of the signature black pellets that contain yarrock. A soldier under the effects of yarrock is ruthless, and able to shrug off tremendous physical hardship. Unfortunately, for every high there is a crash, and this drug is no exception—as a dose runs its course, its effect seems to reverse, and every step becomes an endless journey until the warrior can metabolize the chemicals or simply collapses from exhaustion. Some also say that the drug has a further effect on the user's very soul, drawing it deeper and deeper into the shadows as time goes on, but validated scientific data on this particular concern is understandably scarce.

[P]Yarrock lasts for one scene. A character under the effects of yarrock is not required to make any Fear checks; he counts as succeeding automatically. However, once he has used yarrock, he must also add [SE] to any Willpower or Presence-related checks for the remainder of the session.

[P][B]Restrictions:[b] Yarrock is quite rare, and thus few planets explicitly regulate its use, as the only shipments go through black market traders.</Description>
