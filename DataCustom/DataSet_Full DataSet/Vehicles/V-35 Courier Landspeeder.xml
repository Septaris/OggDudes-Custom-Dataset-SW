  <Description>[H3]V-35 Courier Landspeeder[h3]

The sleek and angular V-35 Courier is one of SoroSuub's more popular landspeeders. This small, coupe-styled speeder seats three in relative comfort in a sealed, well-appointed cockpit. The forward hull is a sharply tapering, wedge-shaped compartment dominated by a seven section, auto-tinting transparisteel canopy that offers outstanding visibility for both driver and passengers. The rear of the vehicle houses one of SoroSuub's SS80 Dynamo power generators driving a MagLift repulsorlift engine. Forward thrust is provided by three Mk.4 LoFlow cluster turbines mounted in dorsal nacelles at the very rear. 

[P]Despite its aggressive styling, which takes its cues both from starfighter design and the design of SoroSuub's racing landspeeders, the Courier is not a high-performance vehicle. In fact, underneath all of the knife-edge body panels and glossy paint is a staid, reliable vehicle with respectable but not outstanding performance that is perfect for a small family or business.</Description>
