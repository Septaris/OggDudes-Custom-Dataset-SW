  <Description>[H3]Nen-Carvon R-444 Imperial Sky Swooper[h3]
[P]The R-444 Sky Swooper is a repulsorlift-assisted hang glider used by Imperial forces, particularly during stealth raids. Based on the para-wing gliders common on Bespin, its design incorporates traditional wing technology with a small repulsorlift generator that assists with long-distance flight. A light blaster cannon mounted above the pilot allows for minimal offensive capability.
[P]The Sky Swooper is controlled by a combination of hand grips and a bar that also supports the pilot’s feet. Both hands and feet are required to steer the glider, which makes firing the light blaster cannon a tricky proposition when tight maneuvers are called for. The Alliance considers the R-444 an excellent asset when it can be acquired, and a small number are already in the Rebels’ possession.
