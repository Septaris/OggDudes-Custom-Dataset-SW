  <Description>[H3]MandalMotors M3-A Scyk Interceptor[h3]

A small, fleet interceptor manufactured by MandalMotors, the M3-A is named after a swift, vicious lizard native to Tatooine. Lightly armored and powered by a single Koensayr R303 Ion Jet Engine, the Scyk is fast and maneuverable. Its compact design allows for the fighter to be fitted with just a single modular weapon system, which can be swapped out relatively easily, though this may limit the Scyk's role depending on its load. While an excellent interceptor, the M3-A has limited weaponry and light armor, which make it a poor choice for assaults on more heavily armored targets.

[P][I]Note: The M3-A has been given an extra hard point in order to add any one of the listed modular weapon systems.[i]</Description>
