  <Description>[H3]Nebulon-Q Racing Swoop[h3]

Favored by hooligans, swoop gangers, and professional racers, Mobquet's Nebulon-Q is one of the fastest, most powerful swoops on the galactic market. Considered a "muscle swoop" by those who appreciate such things, the Nebulon-Q is the middle sibling in the Nebulon-series swoops. Bigger than the Nebulon-R and more sophisticated than the Nebulon-S, like its siblings the Nebulon-Q is marketed mainly to thrill seekers and professional swoop racing teams. Little more than an engine with a saddle attached, the Nebulon-Q is powered by a high-output version of Mobquet's AE318 swoop engine delivering thrust through a pair of overcharged ion turbofans. Combined with a precision avionics package and fine-tuned control surfaces, the Nebulon-Q provides both blistering straight-line speed and incredible agility in one small package.</Description>
