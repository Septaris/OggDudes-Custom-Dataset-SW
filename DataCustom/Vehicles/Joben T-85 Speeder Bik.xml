  <Description>[H3]Joben T-85 Speeder Bik[h3]
The T-85 Joben is a sporting and enthusiast's speeder bike produced by the Zebulon Dak Speeder Corporation, a small speeder manufacturing company located in the Outer Rim. Solidly built and reliable, the T-85 is easy to ride and simple to maintain. The bike contains few advanced systems and has no weapons, relying instead on speed, comfort, and style to attract buyers. A cruiser style speeder bike, the Joben has high-rise handlebars and forward foot controls, putting the plint in a more relaxed riding position than on a more aggressive bike like a 74-Y or a swoop. Its drive system, an ion engine  licensed from Aratech tuned more for endurance than speed, provides ample power but is more suited ot long distance, open-country riding than to city travel.
[P]Although it is a small company, Zebulon Dak provides a health variety of performance and comfort-enhancing parts for the T-85 and other speeder bikes the company produces. These, along with aftermarket accessories offered by  other companies, allow T-85 owners to customize the bike to their exact needs.</Description>
