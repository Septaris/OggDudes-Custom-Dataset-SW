  <Description>[H3]SakTek HF-2 Hutt Repulsorsled (Hutt Floater)[h3]

Among Hutts, only the very young and the very poor move under their own power, and physical exertion is seen as a sign of weakness. As such, virtually every Hutt owns a personal repulsorsled to get from place to place, even if those places are mere meters apart. Several companies, notably Ubrikkian Industries, Gefferon Pleasure Craft, and the SakTek Corporation, offer a wide variety of repulsorsleds to meet any Hutt's tastes. SakTek's HF-2 is a common model favored by many Hutts both for its functionality and the availability of a variety of luxury option upgrades.</Description>
