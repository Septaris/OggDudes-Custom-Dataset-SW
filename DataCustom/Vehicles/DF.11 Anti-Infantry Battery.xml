  <Description>[H3]DF.11 Anti-Infantry Battery[h3]

Golan Arms’ DF.11 is one of the more popular antiinfantry
artillery weapons on the galactic market
today. Used by both the Imperial Army and Rebel
Alliance ground forces, the DF.11 is a powerful, reliable
weapon typically found guarding the approaches
to permanent and semipermanent military garrisons.
The weapon itself is a short range, turret-mounted,
double-barrel, light laser cannon mounted atop a
short, armored, and lightly shielded tower. It fires a
powerful and accurate laser beam over long distances
that creates a wide area effect burst of energy upon
impact. This blast can destroy whole squads of unarmored
or lightly armored infantry, and even lightly
armored vehicles, with a single, well placed shot. The
DF.11 comes equipped with its own power generators
and requires a crew of three—a gunner, a technician,
and a fire control operator—to operate at top
efficiency.
[P]While DF.11 s are popular and effective weapon
emplacements, they do suffer from a handful of shortcomings.
They are, by nature, static emplacements.
Breaking down a DF.11 for transit is a long and arduous
task that requires a team of at least six technicians; it
is not something that can be undertaken in the heat of
battle. In addition, while the DF.11 is a potent weapon, it’s also a slow-firing energy hog that requires constant
technical attention to keep functioning properly It is best
used in conjunction with lighter, more flexible weapons
like E-Webs and other light and heavy repeating blasters.
[P]The DF.11 emplacement is a small, immobile vehicle
for game purposes.</Description>
