  <Description>[H3][I]Rufescent[i] Cargo Hauler[h3]
A widely produced bipedal heavy loader, TaggeCo's [I]Rufescent[i]-class cargo hauler has achieved popularity due to its modular nature and ease of modification. Uts large number of anchor points and sturdy construction have made it a particular favorite of certain criminal groups and desperate vigilantes, who employ it as a mobile heavy weapons platform by attaching ranged armaments to the cargo arms. Though offering minimal protection to the rider, the [I]Rufescent[i] has proven an effective makeshift support vehicle in urban combat, especially for those who cannot afford military-grade walkers. While it is no match for Imperial armor on the battlefield, its small profile makes it extremely useful in environments where heavier walkers cannot easily operate.</Description>
