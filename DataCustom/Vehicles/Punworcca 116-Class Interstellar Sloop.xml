  <Description>[H3][I]Punworcca 116[i]-class Interstellar Sloop[h3]
The [I]Punworcca 116[i]-class Interstellar Sloop is a solar sailer-a beautiful and ancient class of vessel that uses an immense sail to draw energy particles from surrounding space to power its hyperdrive.
[P]The [I]Punworcca 116[i] was built by the Huppla Pasa Tisc Shipwrights Collective on Geonosis, and was primarily designed as a personal yacht for the wealthy and important. It is not a practical vessel-it barely has room for 2 passengers in addition to the pilot (most owners tended to use a droid to pilot the ship), and not much cargo space. In addition, the huge sail can be an impractical method of travel, especially in dangerous regions of space.
[P]Characters may encounter similar solar sailers when traveling in the far reaches of the Outer Rim and beyond, where older vessels are still occasionally used.</Description>
