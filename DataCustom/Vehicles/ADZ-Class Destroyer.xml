    [H3]ADZ-Class Destroyer[h3]

One of the smallest capital ships in the Imperial Navy's arsenal, the Adz-class destroyer is a relative newcomer to the galactic spacelanes. Produced by Kuat Drive Yards (KDY). the Adz-class is designed for long-range patrol duty. Best described as tall and angular, these vessels have a long, narrow, slab-sided hull flanked by port and starboard sponsons that house the primary thrusters and sensor systems. Their prows are steeply angled wedges rising to tall super-structures that house the ships' powerful soliton-wave antennae, which can sense the comings and goings of other vessels in hyperspace, and their attendant cooling systems. Thanks to state-of-the-art slave-circuit systems, these vessels have a very small crew for their size and can operate at peak efficiency with only a handful of officers and crew.

[P]The ship has some issues: the foremost that the sensor suite suffers from being mated to the finicky, high-maintenance soliton antenna and is prone to brownouts, spoofing, and signal interference. In addition, the soliton antenna drains power at a ferocious rate. Despite these complaints, many Adz-class destroyers are already patrolling out-of-the-way parts of the Outer Rim.</Description>
