  <Name>Aka'jor-class Shuttle</Name>
  <Description>[H3]Aka'jor-class Shuttle[h3]
Kad Solus named his ship [I]Dikutruni[i] , which translates roughly as "soul of the fool". He has modified the [I]Aka'jor[i]-class shuttle by adding armament, shielding, and a faster hyperdrive. Kad uses the ship to track bounties across the region, and to make contacts for new bounty acquisition. It features a narrow, boxy fuselage with a pair of large S-foilds that rotate into a vertical position for landing. The rear of the ship has a small lift for boarding and cargo.</Description>
