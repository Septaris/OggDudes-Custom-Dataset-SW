    [H3]Delta-6 System Defense Starfighter[h3]

Small, fast, and agile. the Delta-6 Sprite-class starfighter was introduced by Kuat Systems Engineering in the decades leading up to the Clone Wars. Descended from earlier KSE designs and the Delta-X technology testbed, the Delta-6 was envisioned initially as a short-range point defense interceptor. An incredibly simple starfighter. the Delta-6 is a lightweight, single-seat interceptor with a narrow, arrowhead-shaped hull. Mounted all the way aft over the engines is a tiny, cramped cockpit with a bubble canopy, which gives the pilot a nearly 360-degree view of the surroundings. Standard armament consists of a pair of high-output Taim &amp; Bak light laser cannons, with light armor and shields. As they are short-range fighters, these fighters have no hyperdrives, astromech ports, or navicomputers, and carry only minimal stores.

[P]After its initial release and the first glowing reviews of its performance and efficiency, the Delta-6 caught the eye of the Jedi Order. The Order took delivery of several squadrons of Sprites, which quickly became the Jedi's go-to fightercraft. After decades of faithful service, the Sprite's short range and light armament were seen as outdated, and they were phased out in favor of the Delta-7 and Delta-7B. Today, Delta-6 interceptors are usually found only in the service of out-of-the-way planetary defense forces or small private concerns.</Description>
