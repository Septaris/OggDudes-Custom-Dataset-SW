    [H3]A-A3 Dray Light Speeder Truck[h3]

Smaller and lighter than the heavy A-A5 speeder truck, the A-A3 Dray by Trast Heavy Transports is a common sight throughout the galaxy. Designed as a light duty speeder truck and marketed to craftsmen and contractors as work vehicles and light cargo haulers, Drays feature an enclosed cab that seats three abreast and a long, open bed that can carry cargo or passengers. Numerous aftermarket accessories for the Dray, such as soft and hard-top covers for the bed, cargo-handling systems, and reinforced structures, and the ease with which the speeder can be repaired and modified make the Dray a popular exploration and backcountry sporting vehicle as well as a reliable workhorse.</Description>
