  <Description>[H4]Scholar - The Gift of Knowledge[h4]

[P]At first, the idea of a Scholar wandering with a bunch of ne'er-do-wells in the Outer Rim might seem a bit odd, if not downright ridiculous. However, with all of the dangers and wonders of "a thousand thousand worlds,' having someone around who actually knows something more than how to reload a heavy blaster could be exceedingly useful under any number of circumstances. This is especially true when a group is faced with something truly unknown, or needs to find something that simple tracking alone cannot locate.

[P][B]Knowledge (Outer Rim), Knowledge (Underworld), Knowledge (Xenology),[b] and [B]Perception[b] are the Scholar's bonus career skills from his specialization. If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. These skills emphasize both his role as a font of information and his keen awareness of his surroundings.

[P]Even in the Outer Rim, there are those who have a keen respect for knowledge and learning. Even criminal overlords find having some "brains" around helps them when they want to expand their operations or exploit a new opportunity. Other Scholars, however, are far more interested in getting out into the galaxy, seeing for themselves the things they wish to study, and digging around in ancient places for the lost knowledge they want to uncover.

[P]A Scholar in a group is very likely of the field researcher variety; seeking allies with physical capabilities who can defend him is a matter of simple expediency. It may be that he's signed on with some kind of operation that actually has no direct impact on his research, but the group is likely to travel to places he wishes to go, which suits his desires well.</Description>
