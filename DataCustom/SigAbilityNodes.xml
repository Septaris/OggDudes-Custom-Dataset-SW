    <Key>COUNTERESPBASE</Key>
    <Name>Counterespionage Base Ability</Name>
    <Description>Once per game session the character may spend 2 Destiny Points to make an [B]opposed Knowledge (Warfare) vs. Deception check[b] against an identified enemy agent or espionage leader. If successful, the character utterly foils one previously identified ploy or tactic associated with that enemy’s act of espionage. The exact nature of how the character accomplishes this must be approved by the GM, but should be suitably cunning and clever. Note that the enemy character does not need to be physically present or near the character for this ability to be used, and that the GM has final say on which NPCs are valid targets.</Description>
