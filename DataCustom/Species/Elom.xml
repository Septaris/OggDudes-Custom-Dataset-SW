  <Description>[H4]Elom[h4]
The Eloms and Elomin share similar names and the
same homeworld, but are physically and culturally
very different species. The Elomin are tall and exclusively bipedal, with physical traits similar to those of
other humanoid species in the galaxy. The Eloms are
shorter, stockier, and covered in fur, and have a large
head with widespread eyes. The Elomin were known
first to the rest of the galaxy, after Republic scouts first
made contact with the world. In fact, the surface dwelling Elomin were themselves ignorant of the Eloms'
existence until the former pursued extensive mining efforts and inadvertently crashed into the Eloms'
underground territories. The Elomin were not keen to
share their cold, dry world, but eventually yielded to
Republic pressure. The two species pursue a separate
existence from each other whenever possible.
[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Eloms evolved for life
underground. They are short and have a solid, stocky
build, with large hands and feet that end in large
curved claws. They are adept at digging underground
using their clawed hands and prehensile clawed toes
They have wide heads with short, stubby eye stalks
on either side. Their dependence on centuries of
phosphorescent light underground enables them to
see very well in dim light, but this makes them very
sensitive to the bright light of the surface world. The
Eloms have a pair of closely set tusks low on their
face, with nasal features set high between their eyes
The Eloms regulate their body temperature and moisture retention through a combination of rough, oily
fur and layers of fat. They are herbivores and are
particularly adapted to eating the unusual plants and
fungi that can be found or cultivated underground on
their home planet, also named Elom.
[P]Despite their laid-back manner, Eloms are intelligent and can be very ambitious. They are also highly isolated from other sepcies, so Eloms unleashed on the wider galaxy tend to be a bit naive, at least initially. This makes them susceptible to suggestions, manipulation, and deception to convince them to do things against their own interests. Those Eloms who do travel the galaxy usually adapt gradually to a more cosmopolitan lifestyle.
[P][B]Society:[b] The Eloms reside almost exclusively
underground on their homeworld. Prior to discovery
by the Elomin during the days of the form er Republic,
they were not technologically advanced. In fact, their
mannerisms and unique societal structures prom pted
the Elomin to regard them initially as non-sentient,
and so they once frequently enslaved Eloms in their
mines. The Republic's representatives found otherwise and forced the Elomin to form ally recognize the
Eloms as a species with rights that they must respect.
[P]The Eloms are largely pacifists and usually easy
to get along with. Despite the difficulties during the
many years after the Elomin discovered them, the
Eloms were willing to put aside past Elomin behavior
and move forward in peaceful coexistence. The Elomin were initially wary, and reluctant to accept responsibility for the oppression of the Eloms. However, after the
Republic's intervention, the Eloms never sought retribution against the Elomin, and eventually tensions
eased between the two societies, though they largely
ignored each other. Most Eloms preferred their underground society to what waited beyond the surface or
among the stars. Years of Imperial rule have altered
that position, especially among the younger Eloms.
[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Elom is a frigidly cold desert world.
Elomin settlements and cities dot the surface. Their
cities are as technologically advanced as those found
on most Imperial worlds. The planet is best known
as a source of lommite, which is used in the manufacture of transparisteel windows for starships and
other craft. Originally an industry contracted out to
offworld mining operators, it is now controlled by the
Empire. Whereas the original agreements tried to
preserve and respect the planet’s environment, the
Imperials place efficiency and production well above
local concerns. The steady, continued destruction
of vast areas of their world trouble and anger both
the Elomin and Eloms. Both have been powerless to
slow it down, let alone bring it to a halt.
[P]Elomin cities and towns are clustered in the more
hospitable environments around the harsher deserts. Mining operations are farther afield, given that
mines close to the oldest cities were depleted long
ago. Imperial interests and operations focus on the
mines. Imperials in the cities have no qualms about
forcing Elomin into service as miners. Banishment
to the mines is a common and cruel form of punishment for anyone who opposes the Empire or offends
the wrong Imperial official. However, reasons for
hauling someone away are just a formality, and the
Elomin understand that anyone could be next.
[P]The Empire has largely ignored the Eloms’ deep
cities, located far below the planet’s surface. The
cities have varying levels of technology, depending
on the location and even the neighborhood within a
settlement. Most advanced technology is imported
from the Elomin and sometimes beyond. Many cities, remote caverns, and dwellings are connected
by natural and Elom-constructed tunnels. The tunnels range in size from those requiring single file passage, to more sophisticated varieties with pavd floors and reinforced roofs. Some are large enought to allow forspeeder traffic. Many of the cities and tunnels are so far underground that the Imperials have difficulty detecting them, let alone setting up surveillance. The cities are largely home to just the Eloms. However, some Elomin resued from Imperial mining efforts have been allowed to live among the Eloms indefinitely.
[P][B]Language:[b] The Eloms and Elomin have separate languages. The Eloms speak and read Elom,
which non-Eloms can understand but typically have
great difficulty speaking. Likewise, the Eloms can
learn to speak Basic, but it isn’t easy given their
physiology. It is rare to find much in the way of Basic
spoken or displayed in the isolated Elom underground cities. M ost Eloms who speak Basic live offworld, or have some connection to those who do.</Description>

            Elom may use a move maneuver to travel through loose soil or similar terrain.  Can result in low, narrow tunnel that others can use, at GM's discretion.
