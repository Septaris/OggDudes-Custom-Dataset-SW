    [H4]Mandalorian Human[h4]
The Mandalonans are among the most feared and
recognizable combatants In the galaxy. Respected
as members of the pinnacle of warrior cultures, most
Mandalorians receive comprehensive combat training
during adolescence. While Mandalorians once united
to launch great crusades that reshaped galactic borders. they are now fractured and strewn about the
galaxy, wielding little power.
[P][B]Physiology:[b] Mandalorians are typically humans. though
their practice of adoption allows members of any species to be raised within Mandalorian culture. Despite
their reputation as fearsome warriors with keen tactical minds. there are no significant biological or physiological differences between Mandalorian humans and
baseline humars. Oddly enough, there are no recorded
instancess of Force sensitivity appearing in Mandalorian
society, though this might be owed to a lack ofJedi testing and Republic record keeping.
[P][B]Society:[b] Mandalonan society traditionally centered
around warfare. Throughout history, its members
fought for both honor and credits which equal
fervor. Recently, Mandalorian culture has fractured into three separate groups: The New
Mandalorians, The Death Watch, and the Old
Mandalorians.
[P]The New Mandalorians followed Duchess Satine
Kryze during the Clone Wars, and believed in moving
Mandalorian culture beyond its warrior past. These
pacifist Mandalorians believed in the potential economic power of Mandalore, built around the export
of Beskar, or Mandalorian Iron. With complete control of the beskar mines, the New Mandalonans, after
years or civil war, wrested control of their homeworld
and steered their people onto a more peaceful path.
Unfortunately, it was nol to last.
[P]When the New Mandalonans rose from the ashes
of Mandalore's Civil War, they banished unrepentant
warrior-clans to the moon of Concordia. The Death
Watch is the most infamous group, known for their
bloodthirsty savagery and desire for conquest. During
the Clone Wars, the Death Watch returned to exact their revenge. They were ultimately defeated, but
members remain in hiding on Mandalore and Concordia awaiting the next call to arms.
[P]The Old Mandalorians also endured exile after the
Civil War. However, rather than plot revenge on Concordia, many resettled elsewhere in the galaxy. Concord
Dawn, Gargan, Ordo, and Vlemoth Port are but a few of
the worlds that support Mandalonan expatriates. Here,
the Mandalorians live as they have for millennia, working for the highest bidder. Old Mandalorians are considered honorable and dangerously competent amongst
their deadly trade. They prioritize lheir family and clan
above all else. and train as warriors from a young age.
[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Mandalore is a planet scarred by years or
civil war. While lush forests, lakes, and mountains once
covered the planet, it is now predominantly barren
wasteland. Inhabitants are forced to live in domed cities,
such as Sundari, the capital during the reign of Duchess
Kryze's New Mandalorians. Sundari enclosed one of the
largest active beskar mines on Mandalore, making it a
major strategic asset. Presently, the Empire has control
of Mandalore, where it operates an Imperial Academy.
[P][B]Language:[b] Mando'a is the traditional language of the
Mandalorians, though most also speak fluent Basic.
Mando'a is especially popular among the Old Mandalorians, who find the language allows a greater degree of
precision in speech when discussing combat. In
addition to a more traditonal alphabet,
Mandalorians also used a set of glyphs
unique to their society that adorned
armor, vehicles, items, and buildings.</Description>
