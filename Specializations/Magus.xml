  <Description>[H4]Magus - Following a Different Path[h4]
To hear of a Magus, even during the time of the Galactic Republic, would be a rare event; to meet one, even more so. The Jedi Order, in its waning days, had become quite conservative regarding explorations into the Force. The Jedi either avoided or outright fought the myriad of sects and cults exhibiting mystical powers throughout the galaxy. The Force, they reasoned, was all they needed. Other teachings and experiments deviated too much from the clear path of the Jedi and thus danced too close to illusion and self-deception, leading to temptations toward the dark side of the Force.
[P]Paradoxically, a Force user may be more likely to become a Magus during the Galactic Civil War. With hope and the light in short supply, some disciples may be more open and willing to seek out so-called forbidden knowledge. A Magus develops and collects a hodgepodge of strange rituals and odd practices to commune with the Cosmic Force. They have no training, but at the same time, they have no teachings that would convince them not to try. The danger, of course, comes from a lack of oversight. Without a guiding hand or proper self-reflection, a Magus has a greater chance to experiment with powers fueled by the dark side of the Force.
[P]The Magus receives [B]Coercion, Discipline, Knowledge (Lore),[b] and [B]Medicine[b] as additional career skills. When starting with this specialization, the Magus may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each.
[P]Knowledge, especially forbidden knowledge, fuels the Magus. Unrestricted by the Jedi Order, defiant of the Galactic Empire, the Magus seeks a connection to the Force through knowledge. The source of that knowledge doesn't matter; rituals, objects and places of power, and ancient religious and magical texts all hint at a singular source of energy. While some Magi crave knowledge for its own sake, most explore the Magus path in order to control the Force itself.
[P]If the Force flows through everything and is a part of everything, then by manipulating the Force, the Magus can manipulate reality. The Force can be used to make matter, affect matter. affect life. and perhaps...even create life. With this power, the Magus can do amazing and impossible things. No, not impossible, for nothing is impossible if one believes in the Force.
[P]This confidence, however, is the biggest trap for Magi. They can do impossible things, yes, but it is the Force that allows them to do so, not their knowledge or talent. Despite what they may think, Magi still have mortal trappings. They have histories, memories, early thoughts, and emotions that can never be truly removed. Hubris may be the greatest enemy for Magi. This hubris can trick Magi into thinking that pushing here or pulling there might be for the good of all, or for the good of the Force, but in reality, they are manipulating the Force for their own selfish needs. Many a Force-using tyrant became a Magus before falling to the dark side.</Description>
