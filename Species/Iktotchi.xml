  <Description>[H4]Iktotchi[h4]
[P]Hailing from the Expansion Region, Iktotchi are immediately recognizable by the downwards-curving horns that sprout from the sides of their heads. Despite their distinct and memorable physical appearance, their species is most renowned for a trait not visible to the naked eye: precognition. Their seemingly supernatural precognititive abilities once made the Iktotchi particularly interesting to both the old Jedi Order and to various organizations as top-tier pilots. Despite their potent gifts, few Iktotchi leave their world to interact with outsiders.
[P][B]Physiology:[b]On a basic level, Iktotchi follow what many consider to be the standard pattern for sentients in the galaxy: two legs, two arms, and a head, all connected by a torso. They stand approximately 1.8 meters high on average and typically have a brown, orange or pink hue to their skin. In modern society, their twin horns serve no major practical purpose. The horns of male Iktotchi tend to grow larger than those of female Iktotchi. though this is by no means an exact indicator of any individual's sex or gender.  Should an Iktotchi's horns become damaged, they grow back over time in most cases. Also notable are their hands, which are almost half again as large as most similarly sized species, with relatively thick fingers. Members of the species enjoy a 90-year life expectancy, given ideal conditions.
[P]Iktotchi possess precognitive abilities that they can hne through training, although these are considerably reduced in effectiveness away from their homeworld, the desolate moon called Iktotch. Some Iktotchi have also reported to possess telepathic capabilities, but whether these Iktotchi actually have a gift for reading minds or can simply extrapolate others' thoughts by perceiving the future remains unclear to xenobiologists. To the Iktotchi themselves, for whome time does not appear as linear as it does to other species, the practical distinction betweeen clairvoyance and telepathy is often blurry or irrelevent. Most humans do not seek to understand the biological principles that allow their eyes to transform light into coherent images; to most Iktotchi, precognition is as important yet mundane as sight. Iktotchi who hone their gift of oresight can grow extremely skilled as seers, however, and can often hold positions of prestige in society.
[P][B]Society:[b] Iktotchi society can be disconcerting to outsiders, expecially if they come unprepared for its unique quirks. Although Iktotchi still use spoken language, the capacity to know what others will say before they say it means Iktotchi  society is disturbingly quiet  to members of most other species. Nonnative used to livelier gatherings may find the hushed conversations of the Iktotchi offputting. Additionally, the gift of precognition makes direct confrontation far less prevalent in society. Interpersonal  and military conflicts are resoved in the mind's eye rather than through force of arms, and most Iktotchi are cautious in action.
[P]The Iktotchi have enjoyed a unified, representatively-democratic government for almost their entire history. Apart from appearing threatening and unapproachable to outsiders (and being banned from most gambling halls across the galaxy), the Iktotchi enjoy a positive reputation. The world and society are known for their relative tranquility in a tumultuous galaxy. In fact, despite their fearsome appearance, most Iktotchi choose not to venture out into the wider, more dangerous galaxy when offered a change to leave placid Iktotch.
[P]With the (to the Iktotchi, unsurprising) advent of the Empire, almost all Iktotchi returned to their homeworld, where giant orbital stations were built to accommodate the sudden influx of returning citizens. Since then, the Iktotchi have adopted an isolationist policy, and the Empire has been content to leave them to their own devices rather than deal with their strange abilities on the galactic stage.
[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Iktotchi homeworld is a moon named Iktotch, which orbits around the gas giant Iktotchon. Located within the Narvath sector of the Expansion Region, the moon's days are twenty-two hours long, and an Iktotchian year comprises of 418 days. Arid, rocky and windy, the moon can seem a harsh environment to newcomers, but the Iktotchi themselves are well adapted to the climate and find it comfortable. The moon's gravity falls within a standard deviaion of the norm, and the weather is reasonably fair, aside from the frequent windstorms. One surprising feature of the moon is a large Republic crest, visibile from space. This massive symbol is preserved as a remnant from the days when the Iktotchi foresaw the arrival of the Old Republic vessel that would offer them the chance to join the Republic. These forebears responded accordingly, carving the symbol to welcome the representatives of the Republic.
[P][B]Language:[b] Iktotchi speak Iktotchese to eachother. In comparison to other languages, Iktotchese is a fairly straight-forward language. It lacks the variance and complex double meanings found in most other tongues. Xenolinguists tend to assume this stems from the fact that the precognitive Iktotchi can see through most misdirections and duplicity. Despire its relative simplicity, the language is complete, though it often incorporates loan-words, especially after contact with the Old Republic. Iktotchi typically have no difficulty learning and communicating in Basic.
[P][B]Perception of the Force:[b] The Iktotchi have a long tradition of seers who hone their innate precognitive abilities, which the Jedi Order took a particular interest in when Iktotch joined the Old Republic. The Jedi soon discovered that even rudimentary training in the Force increases the potency of an Iktotchi's precognitive abilities dramatically.
[P]During the days of the Republic the Iktotchi produced their fair share of Jedi Knights (as well as other types of Force users) who used their natural talents to augment the already impressive powers granted by the Force. To beings who can intuitively grasp future events, the Force might not seem as mystica and unknowable as it does to other species, but thanks to their acquaintence with prophecy, the Iktotchi have a deep respect for the power of the Force. The Jedi the Iktotchi have produced are often viewed as heroes. Even in the era of the Empire, these champions are remembered fondly on Iktotch, if spoken of infrequently and in hushed words.</Description>
