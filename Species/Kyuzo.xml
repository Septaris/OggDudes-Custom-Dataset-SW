  <Description>[H4]Kyuzo[h4]
Kyuzo are lanky, bipedal humanoids who hail from the
world of Phatrong. Their frequently slender physique
belies their form idable strength and surprising agility.
Kyuzo are not a prominent species in the galaxy at
large, but some travel extensively for business, trade,
and exploration.
[P]There are many social and political organizations on
their homeworld Phatrong, but one particularly noteworthy cultural phenomenon is that of clovocs, groups
that maintain law and order in specific regions. The
members of the most elite clovocs on Phatrong are
renowned for their skill and honor, and are thus valued by military recruiters, underworld organizations,
and other groups that require skilled fighters.
[P][B]Physiology:[b] Kyuzo are green-skinned, and display
hues ranging from lighter olive shades to deep bluegreen colors. They are bipedal, with thin arms and
legs that conceal their considerable strength. Their
hands have four digits. Due to the uncommon makeup
of their homeworld’s atmosphere, Kyuzo frequently
wear filter masks when in a galactic standard habitable environment. Though going without these masks
isn’t fatal, doing so makes Kyuzo ill in a short time,
interferes with their ability to concentrate, and slows
them down considerably. Like many species, Kyuzo
span a broad range in term s of height and build, with
some members of the species towering over most
humans and others considerably smaller in stature.
[P]Interestingly, there are two primary phenotypes
within the Kyuzo population; some have compound
eyes, while others have eyes with pupils akin to those of humans. The exact genetic history behind this divergence is known to few non-Kyuzo scholers, but the two groups are genetically compatible, with offspring inheriting one trait or the other from a parent.
[P][B]Society:[b] The Kyuzo are a highly political species.
Starting with early city-states, the Kyuzo developed
societies that spanned considerable geographic
areas. Most Kyuzo identify as members of a particular
country or region. Separate from these governments
are the clovocs, which are organizations of warriors
and o ther combatants that have their own traditions
and rules outside of the political regions they inhabit.
[P]At their best, the clovocs comprise noble fighters
standing for what is right or just. At their worst, they
are bands of vile mercenaries or criminals who are as
formidable as they are greedy. Clovocs range in size
from a few dozen members to thousands of individuals. All forms of Kyuzo government make deals with
the clovocs to provide security and military forces.
The politics behind the successful hiring of a clovoc
are complex and sometimes outright corrupt. Many
a government has been toppled when a clovoc abandoned it for better pay elsewhere or as an extreme
form of protest over that government’s actions,
though few clovocs would abandon a battlefield for
such reasons when actual fighting is underway.
[P]Some clovocs encourage their members or even
entire branches to work offworld as mercenaries,
while others forbid this practice. While most Kyuzo
are not actually members of a clovoc, these organizations nonetheless hold an important place in Kyuzo
culture, and are often romanticized in works of song,
literature, and other art. Though the clovocs are not
monolithic on Phatrong—some regions have more traditional governance structures with integrated
militaries—they are common in several of the largest
nations. Further, because many Kyuzo who travel offworld are members of a clovoc, these warrior orders
are one of the most widely recognized elements of
Kyuzo culture in the galaxy at large.
[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Phatrong is an Outer Rim world, in the
galactic vicinity of Yavin and the Gordian Reach. It is
terrestrial, with vast oceans divided by thin, mountainous, roughly linear continents that stretch between the
planet's poles. Some mountain ranges are bordered
by wide plains and low hills. Others rise steeply out
of the water, forming fjords and long inland canyons.
[P]Kyuzo cities are scattered throughout the continents. Most continents and major islands are their
own political units, though they do form a loose confederation that once elected the planet’s Republic
and Imperial Senators—before the dissolution of the
Senate, at least. The office of the local Imperial governor has since replaced that function, and oversees
the world directly. The Imperials naturally rely on their
own forces to maintain control, and only deal with the
clovocs if they absolutely must. The reputation of the
clovocs has made the Empire cautious on Phatrong,
and as long as taxes are paid on time, it generally
exerts little direct influence over the world.
[P]Phatrong is a technologically developed world with
all of the expected amenities and technologies available to most worlds of the Galactic Empire. The Kyuzo
have a local style they apply to many of their products and services. For those in the know, imported
goods usually stand out.
[P][B]Language:[b] The Kyuzo have their own language, made
up of quickly spoken short words and phrases. They
can learn to understand Basic without difficulty, and
most pick up the skill at a young age, though speaking it is another matter. Some Kyuzo learn to make
themselves understood in Basic while others use
translation devices to smooth their interactions with
outsiders. Most clovocs laud action over words, and
so some Kyuzo warriors who leave Phatrong simply let
their deeds speak for themselves.
[P][B]Life in the Alliance:[b]  Kyuzo fighters who share the
Alliance’s goals are quickly welcomed. Their combat
prowess is highly respected and provides a much-needed boost to units or resistance groups lacking
fighting ability. Those fighters looking for payment
might find limited work with the rebels, but only if they
are desperate for hired help, and if the clovoc involved
has a decent reputation.
[P]Kyuzo rebel sympathizers on Phatrong work tirelessly to recruit like-minded individuals in hopes that
they can bolster both the Alliance at large, and form
the core of a major resistance force on their homeworld. Many Kyuzo who join the Rebel Alliance are
not members of a clovoc at all. Though the clovocs
dominate the military culture of Phatrong, some fighters still make a living working as lone freelancers.
Other recruits are not combatants at all, and support
the Rebel Alliance with diplomatic guidance, scientific
breakthroughs, or entirely unique expertise developed on, or off, Phatrong.</Description>
