  <Description>[H3]Koensayr AD-15 Modular Multi-Role Starfighter[h3]
As one of the galaxy's major starship parts suppliers. Koensayr seeks to maximize profits through the combination of parts expertise and supply distribution system. One result of the union of skills is the AD-15 Modular Multi-Role Starfighter. It was designed around a standard selection of modules users can employ to adept the fighter as needed for different missions. Corporate designers believed that governments and militaries would like the economics of purchasing of one central chassis to build around, rather than paying for each task that might nor always be needed. Thus they developed the magnetic modular rail system that came to define the AD-15, which lets users rapidly equip new attachments.
[P]Unfortunately, the cost to actually equip the fighter with components that meet millitary standards and Koensayr's noncompetitive lock on its propreitary parts and maintenance supplies diminished interest int he ship. However, the AD-15 found some success as a defender on board corporate and exploration starships with limited hanger space, where its multi-mission capability became an asset. A starfighter of otherwise average capabilities, the AD-15 has always been more popular with Technicians than pilots. Its adaptable nature makes it very easy to swap in and out custom-made modules, many of which are scratch-built by enterprising owners. Despite Koensayr's attempted monoploy on the parts, many Technicians have found and modified similar products that work just as well with the ship's magnetic modular rails, if not better.</Description>
